      <title>Image_3D performance</title>
      <para>The <ulink url="http://www.zend.com/de/products/zend_guard">ZendGuard</ulink>
offers optimization and encoding for your PHP code. I visited a friend
who ownes a license of ZendGuard so that we had the idea to test it
with something CPU intesinve like <ulink url="http://pear.php.net/package/Image_3D">Image_3D</ulink> . The results were quiet surprising.</para>

      <para>I
was surprised that simply adding the ZendOptimizer to the php.ini
caused a performance breakdown by 5%, and encoding the code, with or
without optimization increased the performance loss to nearly 30%. I
didn't expect a great performance improvement from a bytecode cache,
because the parsing is very minor to all the calculations done while
raytracing.</para>
      <para>The improvements by <ulink url="http://pecl.php.net/package/APC">APC</ulink>
(enabled optimization) are so minimal, that it can be caused by
statistical noise. All the times are the mean value of 5 to 10
iterations - the difference was minimal, so that I didn't see the need
to test it more often.</para>
      <para>I can understand, that the optimizer does
not offer any real improvements, like APC does, but I wouldn't expect
such performance impact.</para>

        <para>We found similar results when we did Zend/ionCube benchmarking in Feb this year - <ulink url="http://www.olate.co.uk/development/benchmarks.php">http://www.olate.co.uk/development/benchmarks.php</ulink></para>
