Design document for PDF generation
==================================

:Author: kn

This is design document for the PDF generation in the eZ Components document
component. PDF documents should be created from Docbook documents, which can
be generated from each markup available in the document component.

The requirements which should be designed in this document are specified in
the pdf_requirements.txt document.

Layout directives
=================

The PDF document will be created from the Docbook document object. It will
already contain basic formatting rules for meaningful default document layout.
Additional rules may be passed to the document in various ways.

Generally a CSS like approach will be used to encode layout information. This
allows both, the easily readable addressing of nodes in an XML tree, like
already known from CSS, and humanly readable formatting options.

A limited subset of CSS will be used for now for addressing elements inside the
Docbook XML tree. The grammar for those rules will be::

	Address     ::= Element ( Rule )*
	Rule        ::= '>'? Element
	Element     ::= ElementName '.' ClassName

	ClassName   ::= [A-Za-z_-]+
	ElementName ::= XMLName* | '*'

	* XMLName references to http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#NT-Name

The semantics of this simple subset of addressing directives are the same as in
CSS. A second level title could for example then be addressed by::

	section title

The formatting options are also mostly the same as in CSS, but again only
using a subset of the definitions available in CSS and with some additional
formatting options, relevant especially for PDF rendering. The used formatting
options depend on the renderer - unknown formatting options may issue errors
or warnings.

The PDF document wrapper class will implement Iterator and ArrayAccess to
access the layout directives, like the following example shows::

	$pdf = new ezcDocumentPdf();
	$pdf->createFromDocbook( $docbook );

	$pdf['article > section title']['font-size'] = '1.6em';

Directives which are specified later will always overwrite earlier directives,
for each each formatting option specified in the later directive. The
overwriting of formatting options will NOT depend on the complexity of the
node addressing like in CSS.

Importing and exporting layout directives
-----------------------------------------

The layout directives can be exported and imported to and from files, so that
users of the component may store a custom PDF layout. The storage format will
again very much look like a simplified variant of CSS::

	File       ::= Directive+
	Directive  ::= Rule '{' Formatting* '}'
	Formatting ::= Name '=' '"' Value '"' ';'
	Name       ::= [A-Za-z-]+
	Value      ::= [^"]+

List of formatting options
--------------------------

There will be formatting options just processed, like they are defined in CSS,
and some custom options. The options just reused from CSS are:

- background-color
- background-image
- background-position
- background-repeat
- border-color
- border-width
- border-bottom-color
- border-bottom-width
- border-left-color
- border-left-width
- border-right-color
- border-right-width
- border-top-color
- border-top-width
- color
- direction
- font-family
- font-size
- font-style
- font-variant
- font-weight
- line-height
- list-style
- list-style-position
- list-style-type
- margin
- margin-bottom
- margin-left
- margin-right
- margin-top
- orphans
- padding
- padding-bottom
- padding-left
- padding-right
- padding-top
- page-break-after
- page-break-before
- text-align
- text-decoration
- text-indent
- white-space
- widows
- word-spacing

Custom properties are:

text-columns
	Number of text text columns in one section.
page-size
	Size of pages
page-orientation
	Orientation of pages

Not all options can be applied to each element. The renderer might complain on
invalid options, depending on the configured error level.

Special layout elements
=======================

Footers & Headers
-----------------

Footnotes and Headers are special layout elements, which can be rendered
manually by the user of the component. They can be considered as small
sub-documents, but their renderer receives additional information about the
current page they are rendered on.

They can be set like::

	$pdf = new ezcDocumentPdf();
	$pdf->createFromDocbook( $docbook );

	$pdf->footer = new myDocumentPdfPart();

Each of those parts can render itself and calculate the appropriate bounding.
There might be extensions from the basic PDFPart class, which again render small
Docbook sub documents into one header, or just take a string, replacing
placeholders with page dependent contents.

Possible implementations would be:

ezcDocumentPdfDocbookPart
	Receives a docbook document and renders it using a a defined style at the
	header or footer of the current page. Placeholders in the text,
	represented by, for example, entities might be replaced.
ezcDocumentPdfStringPart
	Receives a simple string, in which simple placeholders are replaced.

Other elements
--------------

There are various possible full site elements, which might be rendered before or
after the actual contents. Those are for example:

- Cover page
- Bibliography
- Back page

To add those to on PDF document you can create a pdf set, which is then rendered
into one file::

	$pdf = new ezcDocumentPdf();
	$pdf->createFromDocbook( $docbook );

	$set = new ezcDocumentPdfSet();
	$set->parts = array(
		new ezcDocumentPdfPdfPart( 'title.pdf' ),
		$customTableOfContents,
		$pdf,
		$bibliography,
	);
	$set->render( 'my.pdf' );

Some of the documents aggregated in one set can of course again be documents
created from Docbook documents. Each element in the set may contain custom
layout directives.

Drivers
=======

The actual PDF renderer calls methods on the driver, which abstract the quirks
of the respective implementations. There will be drivers for at least:

- pecl/libharu
- FPDF

Renderer
========

The renderer will be responsible for the actual typesetting. It will receive a
docbook document, apply the given layout directives and calculate the
appropriate calls to the driver from those.

The renderer optionally receives a set of helper objects, which perform relevant
parts of the typesetting, like:

Hyphenator
	Class implementing hyphenation for a specific language. We might provide a
	default implementation, which reads standard hyphenation files.

Additional renderer features
----------------------------

If the used driver class implements the respective interfaces the renderer will
also offer to sign PDF documents, or add write protection (or similar) to the
PDF document.
