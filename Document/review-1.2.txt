Parsing Issues with RST:

1. in docs/install.txt, it doesn't like
		spl_autoload_register_
   on line 285. Replacing it with:
		`spl_autoload_register_`
   makes it work.
   The error message is:

		PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught exception 'ezcDocumentVisitException' with
		message 'Visitor error: Warning: 'Missing reference target 'register'.' in
		line 285 at position 22.' in
		/home/derick/dev/ezcomponents/trunk/Document/src/document/rst/visitor.php:167

2. in docs/dev_process.txt it throws:

		PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught exception 'ezcDocumentVisitException' with
		message 'Visitor error: Warning: 'Missing reference target 'register'.' in
		line 285 at position 22.' in
		/home/derick/dev/ezcomponents/trunk/Document/src/document/rst/visitor.php:167

   It seems that it doesn't see the:
		1. _`Present the Idea`
   on line 37 as a reference target.


3. docs/articles/2009-01-06-webdav-locking.txt dies with:

		PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught exception 'ezcDocumentVisitException' with
		message 'Visitor error: Notice: 'Unhandeled field list type
		'revision'.' in line 5 at position 1.' in
		/home/derick/dev/ezcomponents/trunk/Document/src/document/rst/visitor.php:167

   and:

		PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught exception 'ezcDocumentVisitException' with
		message 'Visitor error: Notice: 'Unhandeled field list type 'status'.'
		in line 6 at position 1.' in
		/home/derick/dev/ezcomponents/trunk/Document/src/document/rst/visitor.php:167

   perhaps we can do something with it, as it prevents quite a few things from
   parsing. (Also 2007-09-25-workflow-thesis.txt)


PDF generation issues

1. After fixing 1. under RST, the generator outputs:

		Unknown: http://docbook.org/ns/docbook:itemizedlist
		Unknown: http://docbook.org/ns/docbook:literallayout
		...

   This is send to stdout, which makes it appear in the PDF upon redirection.
   I understand that itemizedlist is not understood, but what is wrong with
   literallayout?

   kn: Implements the common error reporting interface now, so that errors aer
   either converted into exceptions, or can be requested later using
   getErrors().

2. While rendering 2009-01-06-webdav-locking.txt there are issues with image
   inclusion. First of all, the file paths in RST are where the images can be
   found *after* the files have been converted. But with PDF generation the
   files have to be the current directory. Perhaps we should add an option to
   "rebase" or "map" paths for image inclusion?

    kn: The original document location has not been maintained when converting
    between multiple document formats, so that the images could not be located
    anymore. Fixed.

3. While rendering 2009-01-06-webdav-locking.txt and fixing 2, I see that the
   image is included on page 2, but no text is below the image. A similar
   issue happens when we render 2007-12-20-tree-yui.txt on page 5.

4. Rendering 2006-01-16-image-manipulation.txt creates a double line of text
   under the image on page 5.
