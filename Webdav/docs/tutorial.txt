Introduction
============

The Webdav component enables you to easily set up a WebDAV-enabled HTTP server.
Users can then create and edit site content by uploading and downloading files
to and from their desktop. The current
implementation is compatible with `RFC 2518`__. It also supports
clients that do not conform to the standard and provides an interface to
support these clients.

__ http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2518

The component is intended to support you by providing access to your data
through the HTTP 1.1 protocol. The data can be stored in the file system, or any other
custom data storage. It is then served as a virtual directory tree to the
user.

Terms
=====

There are some terms used in a WebDAV environment whose meanings differ slightly
from the usage in similar environments.

Collection
	When it comes to WebDAV, a collection means a set of files and other
	collections, which may be compared with directories in a normal file
	system.

Resource
	A resource equals a file, but we use a different term here to differentiate
	between real files on the hard disk and the virtual resources (files) in
	a WebDAV share.

Properties
	There are several default properties, like the modification time or file
	size of WebDAV resources, but you can also store and modify custom
	properties on all resources.

Setting up a WebDAV server
==========================

To set up a basic WebDAV server, you must consider two steps:

1) You need to configure the WebDAV server to work correctly with the incoming
   requests from WebDAV clients. This means that you need to set up some
   rewriting for the request paths (which the client sends) to the paths that
   are used in the back-end.

2) You need to set up the back-end, so that it points to the resources you want to
   share through WebDAV.

Path auto detection
-------------------

Using the default path factory, which tries to auto detect your setup and map
the paths accordingly, you need very little code to setup a WebDAV server.

.. include:: tutorial/basic_server.php
   :literal:

As you can see in the example, we first create a new WebDAV server instance.
Then a file back-end is created, which just receives the directory as a
parameter, where your contents are stored.

Finally we call the method handle() on ezcWebdavServer, which actually
parses and responds to the request with the created back-end as a parameter.

Basic path factory
------------------

A custom path factory enables you to specify the request path mapping to the
path of a resource in the repository. This can be used if the automatic
detection does not work.

.. include:: tutorial/basic_path_factory.php
   :literal:

When assigning the server configuration to the new ezcWebdavBasicPathFactory
object, you provide the base URL, which will always be removed from
the request URLs.

If you need more specialized mapping of request paths to repository paths,
you can write your own path factory, by implementing the ezcWebdavPathFactory
interface, or extending one of the existing path factories.

Testing the server
------------------

You can test the server directly with a WebDAV client of your choice. However,
most WebDAV clients have very poor debugging capabilities.

The WebDAV client with the most verbose error reporting currently is the
`command line WebDAV client cadaver`__, where you might get more information
than failed request notifications.

__ http://www.WebDAV.org/cadaver/

The second step you should take is to enable error logging, either by catching
all exceptions from WebDAV and logging them to a file, or by simply enabling
log_errors in php.ini.

You can also access the WebDAV server with a browser, since WebDAV is just an
extension to the HTTP protocol. You should be able to get valid results out of
this, and also see possible errors. Remember that collections (or directories),
although they can contain other collections and resources, do not consist of
any data themselves. Therefore, if everything
is working properly, you will get a blank page when viewing collections in your
browser. However, you should still be able to download resources (or files) in
the WebDAV share.

Writing a custom back-end
=========================

The most common way of extending a WebDAV server is to provide a custom back-end
to your data. A back-end receives ezcWebdavRequest objects and generates
ezcWebdavResponse objects, which are displayed in a way that the current
client will understand.

There are basically two ways for you to implement a custom back-end. You can
implement all the request object handling yourself, by directly
extending ezcWebdavBackend, or you can reuse the existing helper class
ezcWebdavSimpleBackend.

The simple back-end
-------------------

The simple back-end, defined in the ezcWebdavSimpleBackend class, already
implements all request-to-response mapping, so you only need to implement
several methods that directly access the data in your back-end (like the file
back-end does).

If you need more fine-grained control, or optimizations, you will still need
to extend the basic ezcWebdavBackend class directly. If you want to implement
a custom back-end you could use the file back-end or the memory back-end
(which as mainly intended for testing) as an implementation guide.
