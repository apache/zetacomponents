TODO
====

Prio 1
------

- In certain cases (e.g. eZ Publish integration) the lock plugin must offer a
  public API to its locks. How should we handle this?
- The lock plugin does not lock/unlock the backend, yet.
  
  - We most probably don't need to lock it (if we can leave out lock refreshing there) for:
    
	- GET (just need to replace a GET on lock-null with 404, if )
	- PROPFIND (need to remove/add some properties, but if that results in a
	  race condition, that should not really hurt)
	- OPTIONS

- Lock purging must be done using an API (shell script).
- Update plugin registry to only have 1 before and 1 after request. Fits!
- Did we check for lock null while unlocking (remove!)?

Prio 2
------

- Windows' case-insensitivity with filenames must be checked!
  
- When a resource is created, clients may provide the getcreationdate
  property (and other date properties), to keep the original dates in tact.  We
  currently don't support this at all, it seems, and some (Windows) clients
  seem to provide invalid dates. At least, an attendee described that he got
  1970-01-01 after uploading a file to mod_webdav.

Prio 3
------

- Add test for mime type file info extensions

- Client initial request to deeper URLs for IE?
