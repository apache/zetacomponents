TODO
====

Prio 1
------

- In certain cases (e.g. eZ Publish integration) the lock plugin must offer a
  public API to its locks. How should we handle this?

Prio 2
------

- URL encoding, UTF-8 and other charsets?

  - Tested on Linux. Tests for Windows still needed.

- Windows' case-insensitivity with filenames must be checked!
  
- When a resource is created, clients may provide the getcreationdate
  property (and other date properties), to keep the original dates in tact.  We
  currently don't support this at all, it seems, and some (Windows) clients
  seem to provide invalid dates. At least, an attendee described that he got
  1970-01-01 after uploading a file to mod_webdav.

Prio 3
------

- Add test for mime type file info extensions

- Client initial request to deeper URLs for IE?


- Some DAV clients request locks exactly after the time they requested the lock
  to last. If the request now takes too much time, it may result in an error,
  since the lock is already gone.

  - We should add a certain amount of time before purging.
