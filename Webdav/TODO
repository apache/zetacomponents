TODO
====

1.1alpha1
----------

- Update plugin registry to only have 1 before and 1 after request. Should
  last!
- Check all files/classes for correct @access tags (almost all of the lock
  plugin must have @access private).
- Backend locks currently bail out, if locking fails. They should remove the
  timedout lock instead!
- Replace all occurances of DateTime() with ezcWebdavDateTime() (for serializability).
- Rename $requestGenerator to $checkObserver in lock check info.
- Check for correct error on shared/read lock request.
- Remove lock timeout exception.

1.1beta1
--------

- Other clients need to be tested against the lock plugin.

  - Finder
  - Which others support locks?

- Lock purging must be done using an API (shell script).

- Try to refactor checkViolations() and checkEtagsAndLocks().
- Correct problem with null NS in properties (check for error 100 on creation).

1.2
---

- Shared locks:

  - Find TODOs where shared locks are mentioned
  - During lock:

    - Check for existing locks and violation between shared/exclusive
	- Don't overwrite existing active locks
  
  - During unlock:
    
	- Don't overwrite existing active locks

  - On copy/move

    - Must only the moving lock be set or all?

  - On change
    
	- Only 1 active lock must apply in a shared lock

- In certain cases (e.g. eZ Publish integration) the lock plugin must offer a
  public API to its locks. This API must carefully be designed and implemented.

- Windows' case-insensitivity with filenames must be checked!
  
- When a resource is created, clients may provide the getcreationdate
  property (and other date properties), to keep the original dates in tact.  We
  currently don't support this at all, it seems, and some (Windows) clients
  seem to provide invalid dates. At least, an attendee described that he got
  1970-01-01 after uploading a file to mod_webdav.

later
-----

- Add test for mime type file info extensions
