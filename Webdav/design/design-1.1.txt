Scope
^^^^^

The scope of this document is to describe the enhancements for the Webdav
component version 1.1.

The general goal for this version is to support locking as described in RFC
2518. To achieve this, the if-header must be parsed and respected by the Webdav
component. This currently is not the case. The if-header must also be used to
respect entity tags, which is not an integral part of the locking feature.
However, the support of entity tags is part of this design, too. 

The following issues are covered in this design:

- Webdav does not provide ETags and does not honor the if-header with them
  (#12583).
- Webdav needs to support authentication and authorization to properly support
  locking (#13344).
- Lock support (#12286).

For locking, a plugin based approach has been favored while the Webav
components was initially design. However, it might turn out that the
realization of lock support through a plugin is not as easy as it seemed to be.
Therefore this document describes a plugin based approach in the first place,
but also contains hints about major differences for an integrated approach.

The document is divided into 3 parts. The first part deals with the realization
of functionality that is exclusively meant to support entity tags. The second
part describes features that are exclusively used to support locking.  Since
WebDAV mixes entity tags (originally HTTP/1.1) and locking in some places, the
third section describes the design for these common concerns.

In several sections of this document so called pseudo code is used, to describe
the functionality of an algorithm. These listings do not follow any specific
syntax or semantic rules, but should be intuitively understandable for people
who know a procedural programming language. Their final implementation in PHP
will require much more code and more complex structures. Beside that,
code-reuse will play a role during implementation.

Entity tag support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes the support of entity tags in the Webdav component,
including the usage of the If header with entity tags and the generation and
sending of the ETag header. The If header can also be used with lock tokens.
Therefore its general processing is described in the `Common concerns`_
section.

The following design only refers to the support of entity tags as defined in
the HTTP/1.1 RFC. This includes the headers mentioned in the RFC overview
document and the generation and comparison of entity tags.

=====================
Entity tag generation
=====================

The generation of an entity tag requires uniqueness for a specific state of a
resource (the so-called entity). To achieve this, multiple data about the
resource state must and be combined.

The path of the resource in combination with its last modification time and
content length should be sufficient. The Lighttpd__ web server makes use of
this information on a configurable basis, too. In addition it can use the inode
of the file for entity tag generation. Since inodes are operating system
dependent and only available for file system based back ends, they will not be
used in our entity tag generation scheme. An MD5 hash will be used to create
the tag from a concatination of previosly named data to ensure common length
and appearance of entity tags.

__ http://www.lighttpd.net/

Since entity tags in WebDAV are also available through the getetag
live-property, a common way is needed to generate the entity tags for the
headers and the property. The ezcWebdavSimpleBackend class will therefore
request the getetag property from the extending back end class and use it's
value for the ETag header and validation of incoming entity tags.

The current generation of entity tags in ezcWebdavFileBackend will be replaced
by a mechanism that uses the last modification time and the size of the file.
This mechanism will be implemented generically in ezcWebdavSimpleBackend to
allow other extending backends to use it.

===============
Header handling
===============

The handling of entity tag related headers must take place in several different
architecture levels of the Webdav component.

Transport layer
===============

The transport layer needs to be able to parse the request headers and to
serialize the response headers. Therefore the ezcWebdavHeaderHandler class
will be enhanced to do so.

The class must parse the following new request headers to support HTTP/1.1
entity tag usage:

- If-Match
- If-None-Match

ezcWebdavHeaderHandler will automatically check if both of these headers are
set. If this is the case, both headers will be silently discarded. Such a
combination is undefined per RFC and we will ignore it on the transport level
already.

Both headers can contain a list of weak/non-weak entity tags or the "*" value,
to indicate that the resource must simply exists, no matter in which state. To
represent this in PHP, the parsed headers will be represented either as an
array of string values or as the boolean value true. The headers will be parsed
into every request object automatically, if they are set.

.. Note::
   The section `Common concerns`_ defines the realization of the If header,
   which is similar to If-Match and If-None-Match. It could be useful to
   combine their representations in the Webdav infrastructure. A decision on
   this will be made during realization.

The back end layer must take responsibility for interpreting the parsed headers
and their values.

In addition ezcWebdavHeaderHandler must take care of serializing the ETag
header, if this one is present in a response object. Since the ETag header may
only contain the string value of an entity tag this mechanism is already
implemented in the current response processing.

Back end layer
==============

The interpretation of incoming If-Match and If-None-Match headers must be done
in the back end. The implementation will take place in the
ezcWebdavSimpleBackend class. With every incoming request, no matter which
request method is used, the If-Match and If-None-Match headers will be honored
in the following way (pseudo code): ::

    if ( any precondition for the request fails except for the If-* header )
    {
        return <corresponding error response>;
    }
    if ( If-* header condition is not fulfilled )
    {
        return <error response 412  (Precondition Failed)>;
    }
    process <request> as if no If-* header was set;

Since this behavior will be implemented within the ezcWebdavSimpleBackend
class, it automatically works with all extending back end classes. Back ends
that do not extend ezcWebdavSimpleBackend will have to take care for these
headers on their own.

.. Note::
   It should be documented in the "Writing your own backend" section of the
   Webdav tutorial how ETags should be handled.

Authentication and Authorization support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Support for locking does not work without a proper authentication and
authorization mechanism.

============
Requirements
============

General requirements for authentication and authorization are:

- Authenticate the user by username and password or username and password
  digest.
- Check if the authenticated user has access to the paths affected by the
  request. This also includes recursive checks like for COPY, MOVE and PROPFIND
  requests.

In respect to locking, the following additional requirements must be met:

- Assign a lock token to an authenticated user.
- Check if given lock tokens belong to the authenticated user.

Both requirements should be implemented independently from each other, to allow
using Webdav without suppport for locking, but still have authentication /
authorization support.

======
Design
======

The authentication / authorization support (in future: short "auth support")
will be implemented in the Webdav component itself, not as a plugin. The reason
for this is, that Webdav without auth support does make very little sense.
Plugins will have access to the auth mechanisms to perform additional checks
for custom requests. To fulfill the need of independence between the general
auth support and lock specific auth support, the additional features will be
defined by an interface in the lock plugin that must be implemented by the
configured auth mechanism.

Interfaces
==========

The following sections describe interfaces that are implemented in the Webdav
component itself. The class of an object that is to be assigned to
ezcWebdavServer->$auth must implement at least 1 of the ezcWebdav*Authenticator
interfaces.

ezcWebdavBasicAuthenticator
---------------------------

This interface must be implemented by a class that acts as the central
authentication instance, which supports HTTP Basic authentication style.
Objects that are assigned to ezcWebdavServer->$auth are strongly recommended to
implement this interface::

    <?php
    interface ezcWebdavBasicAuthenticator
    {
        authenticateBasic( string $user, string $password );
    }
    ?>

The authenticate() method will be called to authenticate a user. It receives
the user name and password, submitted by the client via Basic auth, or empty
strings, if no auth information was submitted.

ezcWebdavDigestAuthenticator
----------------------------

In contrast to ezcWebdavBasicAuthenticator, classes which implement this
interface support HTTP Digest authentication style. Objects that are assigned
to ezcWebdavServer->$auth are highly recommended to implement this interface::

    <?php
    interface ezcWebdavBasicAuthenticator
    {
        authenticateDigest( ezcWebdavDigestData $data );
    }
    ?>

The parameter received by authenticateDigest() is a struct containing all
Digest information received through the request. This includes the plain text
user name, the realm and the nonce. All 3 are used to calculate the Digest hash
for authentication. The algorithm used for calculating digest and checksum
hashes is always indicated as MD5 to the client, which should act accordingly.

ezcWebdavAuthorizer
-------------------

This interface must be implemented by auth instances which support
authentication. Authentication is not mandatory to be implemented, but
recommended. If the object residing in ezcWebdavServer->$auth does not implement
the authorizer interface, all users will be allowed to read and write to every
path. This might also happen, if the interface is implemented, but the back end
does not support authorization.

::

    interface ezcWebdavAuthorizer
    {
        const ACCESS_READ  = 1;
        const ACCESS_WRITE = 2;

        public function authorize( $username, $path, $access = ezcWebdavAuthorizer::ACCESS_READ );
    }

The authorize() method will be called by the back end for every $path the
current request tries to access. This might be a single call (e.g. GET requests)
or multiple ones (e.g. COPY and PROPFIND). The $access parameter determines,
which permission is requested by the request. Requests like GET and PROPFIND
require only ACCESS_READ permissions, while e.g. COPY and PUT require
ACCESS_WRITE permissions on certain paths.

ezcWebdavLockAuthorizer
-----------------------

This interface will be provided in the lock plugin and must be implemented by
the central auth instance to support the lock plugin. If this is not the case
and the lock plugin is activated, an exception will be thrown. ::
    
    <?php
    interface ezcWebdavLockAuthorizer extends ezcWebdavAuthorizer
    {
        assignLock( string $user, string $lockToken );
        ownsLock( string $user, string $lockToken );
        releaseLock( string $lockToken );
    }
    ?>

Whenever a lock token is created by a user, the assignLock() method is called.
A lockToken can only be assigned to 1 user, so the assignLock() method must
throw an exception in case a $lockToken is submitted twice. The $timeout value
defines the Unix timestamp when the $lockToken will expire. After that, the
authentication mechanism must release the lock and return false from
ownsLock(). The ownsLock() method checks if the given $user is the owner of the
$lockToken. In case the $lockToken does not exist (maybe because it is
expired), this method throws an exception. The releaseLock() method removes the
$lockToken and the assignment of its user.

A $lockToken might be refreshed, as long as it exists. In case a lock does not
exist anymore, the refreshLock() method must indicate an exception.

Classes
=======

No implementations of the interfaces above will officially be shipped with the
Webdav component. Instead, the ezcWebdavServer->$auth property will be left null
by default, which will lead to no authentication/authorization at all.

If a user implemented object is assigned to the ezcWebdavServer->$auth property,
it must at least implement 1 of the ezcWebdav*Authentication interfaces. It may
also implement the corresponding other one, but this is not mandatory.

In addition, such an object might implement ezcWebdavAuthorizer. This is highly
recommended. Back ends which are aware of authorization (like the
ezcWebdavSimpleBackend) will then perform authorization for the necessary
operations against the object.

In case the lock plugin is to be used by the server, the object in
ezcWebdavServer->$auth must implement the ezcWebdavLockAuthorizer interface
(and therefore the ezcWebdavAuthorizer interface).

Integration
===========

The auth facilities will be implemented in the Webdav component on the server
and back end layers. This is necessary, since only the back end knows about the
path structure and can issue authorization requests for recursive requests. In
addition, some requests must not simply fail, but must return a Multistatus
response including the error response (PROPFIND).

The server layer will take responsibility on authenticating the user, while the
back end takes care about authorization. This way authentication does still work
with back ends that do not support authorization.

The auth process will work as follows:

1. Parse request (transport layer).
2. Authenticate user on basis of abstract request data (server layer).

   - In case the authentication fails, cancel request processing and return 401
     (Unauthorized).

3. Authorize user on basis of abstract request data (back end layer / plugins).

   - In case any of the paths to authorize fails, cancel request processing
     and return 401 (Unauthorized) or react differently, according to the RFC.

4. Go on with normal request processing (plugins, back end).

The ezcWebdavAuth instance used for the auth process is stored in a read/write
property in ezcWebdavServer. It defaults to eczWebdavNoAuth and can be replaced
by an arbitrary object implementing ezcWebdavAuth by the user. Logically this
should happen before the handle() method is called, but theoretically it is
possible anytime.

Lock support
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Locking allows a WebDAV client to gain exclusive access to a resource
(collection or non-collection) to avoid the "lost update problem". 

The WebDAV RFC distinguishes locks by 2 essential properties: The scope of the
lock (shared vs. exclusive) and the type of the lock (write vs. read). Only
write locks are specified by the RFC. Therefore we will only implement write
locks. If read locking becomes necessary sometimes, this can still be added.

A lock is always bound to a principle (not a client!) and one or more
resources. The combination of a principle and a resource is defined through a
unique string, named "lock token".

Using an exclusive lock, a principle ensures that he is the only one to have
write access to the locked resource(s). With a shared lock it is possible that
multiple principles have write access to one and the same resource. More
information on lock scopes is provided in the corresponding RFC overview
document.

This section describes the realization of lock support through a plugin for the
Webdav component. This plugin will make use of the, not yet officially
released, plugin API. The plugin API might still be changed during the
implementation of the lock plugin, which gives more flexibility here.

The goal of this design is is to build a lock plugin that is as far independent
from the other Webdav layers as possibly. This especially means, that the
implementation is independent from the back end. Beside that, the plugin should
provide the largest possible compatibility to clients. However a plugin that
hooks into the parsing process cannot provide the same client compatibility
mechanisms as the base Webdav transport layer. It might be necessary to adjust
the lock plugin to work with several clients and introduce exceptions from the
usual workflow for them.

======
Design
======

In following, the main algorithms and functionalities are described that need
to be implemented for a realization of locking as a plugin. This design does
not so much contain class and interface specifications, because most classes
are internal to the lock plugin and will not be released to the control of the
user. All classes not defined explictly in this document will be marked
private.

Interaction with other parts of the Webdav component is realized by attaching
plugin methods to hooks of the plugin architecture or calling public methods of
other components.

The design description is structured the 3 layers of the Webdav component. Each
section contains the functionality and changes that affect the specific layer.
Mechanisms which are central for the plugin or affect multiple layers are
described in dedicated sections after that.

Transport layer
===============

On the transport layer the plugin needs to hook into the parseUnknownRequest
signal for 2 new request methods. In addition 2 new live properties need to be
parsed, which is realized through the extractUnknwonLiveProperty and
serializeUnknownLiveProperty hooks.

LOCK / UNLOCK requests
----------------------

The LOCK request can not be parsed, yet. The ezcWebdavLockRequest class and
additional content classes already exists (@private) and need to be moved to
the lock plugin directories. To parse the LOCK request, the parseUnknownRequest
hook is used. The generated ezcWebdavLockRequest object is submitted into the
infrastructure flow for further processing. It will be handled on the server
layer by the lock plugin itself.

The same applies for the UNLOCK method.

For both request methods the corresponding response objects still need to be
created and need to be serialized by the handleUnknownResponse hook. Repsonse
objects will be created as needed during implementation, as they are not very
complex.

Properties
----------

The following live properties need to be added:

- lockdiscovery
- supportedlock

For both properties, the property abstraction classes already exist (@private)
and just need to be moved to the lock plugin directories. The parsing and
serializing of these properties needs to be implemented in the plugin. The
hooks extractUnkownLiveProperty and serializeUnknownLiveProperty will be used
for this purpose. This ensures that the properties can also be stored in the
back end properly.

.. hint::
   The plugin needs to use the XML tool class currently active in the server to
   ensure that potential client specific XML handling is used.

If the lock plugin is switched off after it has been activated and used once,
the specified properties should still work since they are then simply
considered to dead properties.

The creation and removal of these properties is handled by the lock plugin on
the server layer.

Server layer
============

On the server layer, the hooks receivedRequest and generatedResponse will be
used to intercept the necessary requests and responses. These are on the one
hand the LOCK and UNLOCK methods, which are exclusively handled by the lock
plugin. On the other hand most other methods must be intercepted to check for
the effect of locks.

During the processing of requests, communication with the backend is necessary.
This communication will be handled by creating corresponding request objects,
sending these to the backend and processing the returned response objects. This
ensures that only minimal adjustments to the back ends themselves is necessary
and that all imaginable back ends will support locking. On the other side, this
raises complexity and lowers performance of the lock mechanism itself. Since
WebDAV is commonly not used by huge masses of users at once, in contrast to
read only accesses to a website, this performance impact should be negligible.

To avoid race conditions while the lock plugin and the backend interact, the
lock plugin must get the posibility to lock the backend completly from
concurring requests. To allow this, a new backend interface will be introduced::

    interface ezcWebdavBackendLock
    {
        public function lock();
        public function unlock();
    }

The lock plugin will not work with backends which do not implement this
interface and will issue an exception if this is tried.

The methods must be implemented by the individual back ends and simply need to
ensure that no other request starts processing as long as the lock is active.
Locking will be performed by the lock plugin from within the receivedRequest
hook, before the plugin issues any request to the backend. After all processing
by the plugin and the backend itself is finished, the unlocking will take place
in the generatedResponse hook.

The following sections describe all necessary funcitionality to be implemented,
except the handling of the If header. This is described in the main section
`Common concerns`_.

LOCK request
------------

Objects of class ezcWebdavLockRequest must be handled completely by the lock
plugin. In case such a request is received, the following operations must be
performed (pseudo code)::

    if ( !authorized( <user>, <path>, WRITE ) )
    {
        return <response 401 Unauthorized>;
    }

    lock back end;
    
    generate <lock token>;
    
    create propfind request for <request path>;
    set Depth header of <propfind request> according to <lock request>; // Infinity if no Depth set

    send <propfind request> to back end;
    
    if ( <requested resource> does not exist )
    {
        if ( If-header was set and no body was present )
        {
            // Refresh lock request without existing lock
            unlock back end;
            return <response 412 Precondition Failed>; 
        }

        create <lock-null resource>;
        assign <lock token> to <lock-null resource>;
    }
    else
    {
        foreach ( <resource> in <PROPFIND response> )
        {
            if ( If header is set )
            {
                refresh timeout of <lockdiscovery> property with <lock token>;
            }
            else
            {
                if ( <resource> is locked exclusively )
                {
                    // Needs to include <lockdiscovery> property of requested
                    // resource without the created lock.

                    return <multistatus response 409 Conflict>;
                }

                if ( <resource> is locked shared and <request> is exclusive )
                {
                    // Needs to include <lockdiscovery> property of requested
                    // resource without the created lock.

                    return <multistatus response 409 Conflict>;
                }

                add <lock token> to <lockdiscovery> property;
                add <user name> to <lockdiscovery> property;
                set <timeout> accordingly;
                set <depth> to <depth> of <request>;
            }

            create <proppatch request> for updated <lockdiscovery> property;
            add <proppatch request> to <requests to send>;
        }
    }

    // If this point is reached, no error has occured, so the lock action can take place.
    foreach ( <requests to send> as <req> )
    {
        send <req> to back end;
    }

    register <authentication> with <lock token>;
    
    unlock back end;
    
    return <prop lockdiscovery response for requested resource>;

A class ezcWebdavLockResponse needs to be created, which can represent the
corresponding responses. Objects of this class will be processed by the
transport layer hooks of the lock plugin and are therefore private.

UNLOCK request
--------------

The UNLOCK operations request object carries exactly one lock token that
indicates the lock to be removed. The UNLOCK operation must release all locks
that are identified by the token.

.. note::
   The RFC does not specify, if the request URI must identify all resources
   affected by the lock, but we will assume that for now. If the request URI
   does not specify the top most affected lock, we would need to iterate the
   whole repository to remove the locks.

The following pseudo code describes the operations to be performed by the
plugin::
    
    if ( !authorized( <user>, <path>, WRITE ) )
    {
        return <response 401 Unauthorized>;
    }

    lock back end;

    create propfind request for <request path>;
    set Depth header to INFINITY;
    send <propfind request> to back end;
    
    foreach ( <resource> in <returned response> )
    {
        foreach ( <assigned lock token> on <resource> )
        {
            if ( expire( <assigned lock token> ) )
            {
                continue;
            }
            if ( <assigned lock token> == <lock token> )
            {
                remove <lock token> from <lockdiscovery> property;
                create <proppatch request> for <lockdiscovery> property;
                add <proppatch request> to <requests to send>;
            }
        }

        if ( <resource> is lock null resource> && no more <lock tokens>
             assigned )
        {
            create <delete request> for <resource>;
            add <delete request> to <requests to send>;
            remove <proppatch request> from <requests to send>;
        }
    }

    foreach ( <requests to send> as <req> )
    {
        send <req> to back end;
    }

    unregister <lock token>;
    
    unlock back end;
    
    return <corresponding response>;

If the lock token could not be found in any of the resources returned by the
PROPFIND request we will indicate success to the client. This case might occur,
if the lock expired right before the client sent the request. However, the lock
is gone as desired by the client.

PUT request
-----------

The PUT method requires 2 additional checks in case the If-header check
succeeded. The necessary actions to take place before the backend processing
can start are described a follows (pseudo code)::

    // Authentication and authorization already took place

    lock back end;
    
    create propfind request for <resource>;
    set Depth header to 0;
    send <propfind request> to back end;

    if ( <resource> exists )
    {
        expireLocks( <resource> );
        foreach ( <assigned lock> on <resource> )
        {
            if ( <assigned lock> is exclusive and If-header does not mention
                 <assigned lock> )
            {
                return <response 423 Locked>;
            }
        }
        if ( <resource> is a lock null resource )
        {
            create <proppatch request> for <resource> to make it a real resource;
            send <proppatch request> to back end;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        expireLocks( <resource> );

        <parent> = get collection <resource>;
        create propfind request for <parent>;
        set Depth header to 0;

        send <propfind request> to back end;

        foreach ( <assigned lock> on <parent> )
        {
            if ( <assigned lock> is exclusive and If-header does not mention
                 <assigned lock> )
            {
                return <response 423 Locked>;
            }
        }
    }

    remove If header from <request>;

    // Let back end perform <request> ...

    unlock back end;

POST request
------------

The POST request is not honored by the Webdav components and will therefore not
be included in lock handling.

PROPPATCH
---------

The necessary extensions to the PROPPATCH method are described below (pseudo
code)::
    
    lock back end;
    
    if ( !authorized( $user, $path, WRITE ) )
    {
        return <response 401 Unauthorized>;
    }

    create propfind request for <resource>;
    set Depth header to 0;
    send <propfind request> to back end;

    expireLocks( <resource> );

    if ( <resource> is a lock null resource )
    {
        return <response 405 Method Not Allowed>;
    }

    foreach( <assigned lock> on <resource> )
    {
        if ( <assigned lock> is exclusive and If-header does not mention
             <assigned lock> )
        {
            return <response 423 Locked>;
        }
    }

    remove If header from <request>;
    // Let back end perform <request> ...

    unlock back end;

MOVE request
------------

For the MOVE request 2 different resource trees need to be checked for locks,
before the request handling can take place. The source tree and the destination
collection. The source tree must be checked with infinite depth, while the
destination collection only requires a zero level check. The whole algorithm is
described below (pseudo code)::
    
    // Authentication and authorization already took place

    lock back end;
    
    create propfind request for <source resource>;
    set Depth header to INFINITY;
    send <propfind request> to back end;
    

    foreach ( <resource> in <returned response> )
    {
        expireLocks( <resources> );

        if ( <resource> is a lock null resource )
        {
            return <response 405 Method not allowed>;
        }

        foreach ( <assigned lock> on <resource> )
        {
            if ( <assigned lock> is exclusive and If-header does not mention
                 <assigned lock> )
            {
                return <response 423 Locked>;
            }
        }
    }
    
    create propfind request for <destination resource>;
    set Depth header to 0;
    send <propfind request> to back end;
    
    expireLocks( <destination resource> );

    if ( <destination resource> exists )
    {
        foreach ( <assigned lock> on <resource> )
        {
            if ( <assigned lock> is exclusive and If-header does not mention
                 <assigned lock> )
            {
                return <response 423 Locked>;
            }
        }

        if ( <destination resource> is a lock null resource )
        {
            // Will be created by the MOVE processing
            delete <destination resource>;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        <parent> = get collection <destination resource>;
        create propfind request for <parent>;
        set Depth header to 0;
        send <propfind request> to back end;

        foreach ( <assigned lock> on <parent> )
        {
            if ( <assigned lock> is exclusive and If-header does not mention
                 <assigned lock> )
            {
                return <response 423 Locked>;
            }
        }
    }

    remove If header from <request>;
    // Let back end perform <request> ...

    unlock back end;

.. Note::
   We assume that a lock null resource may deal as the destination for the MOVE
   method. This is not clarified in the RFC.

COPY request
------------

While only the destination of a COPY method needs to be checked for normal
locks, the source must be checked for lock null resources. Those do not support
the COPY method, so the method must fail, if the tree to copy contains a lock
null resource. Other locks in the source tree do not affect the COPY method,
since read locks are not supported by the Webdav component. The algorithm looks
as follows (pseudo code)::
    
    // Authentication and authorization already took place
    
    lock back end;
    
    create propfind request for <resource>;
    set Depth header to INFINITY;
    send <propfind request> to back end;
    
    foreach ( <resource> in <returned response> )
    {
        if ( <resource> is a lock null resource )
        {
            return <response 405 Method not allowed>;
        }
    }
    
    create propfind request for <destination resource>;
    set Depth header to 0;
    send <propfind request> to back end;
    
    expireLocks( <destination resource> );

    if ( <destination resource> exists )
    {
        foreach ( <assigned lock> on <resource> )
        {
            if ( <assigned lock> is exclusive and If-header does not mention
                 <assigned lock> )
            {
                return <response 423 Locked>;
            }
        }

        if ( <destination resource> is a lock null resource )
        {
            delete <destination resource>;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        <parent> = get collection <destination resource>;
        create propfind request for <parent>;
        set Depth header to 0;
        send <propfind request> to back end;
        
        expireLocks( <parent> );

        foreach ( <assigned lock> on <parent> )
        {
            if ( <assigned lock> is exclusive and If-header does not mention
                 <assigned lock> )
            {
                return <response 423 Locked>;
            }
        }
    }

    remove If header from <request>;
    // Let back end perform <request> ...

    unlock back end;

.. Note::
   We assume that a lock null resource may deal as the destination for the COPY
   method. This is not clarified in the RFC.

DELETE request
--------------

The DELETE method works on collection and non-collection resources and
therefore needs to check infinite depth for locks. Lock null resources do not
support the DELETE action, so the method must fail, if such a resource is to be
deleted. The following pseudo code shows the whole procedure::
    
    // Authentication and authorization already took place
    
    lock back end;
    
    create propfind request for <resource>;
    set Depth header to INFINITY;
    send <propfind request> to back end;
    
    foreach ( <resource> in <returned response> )
    {
        expireLocks( <resource> );

        foreach ( <assigned lock> on <resource> )
        {
            if ( <assigned lock> is exclusive and If-header does not mention
                 <assigned lock> )
            {
                return <response 423 Locked>;
            }
        }

        if ( <resource> is a lock null resource )
        {
            return <response 405 Method Not Allowed>;
        }
    }

    remove If header from <request>;
    // Let back end perform <request> ...

    unlock back end;

MKCOL request
-------------

The MKCOL method is similar to the PUT request in terms of locking. The
following pseudo code shows what needs to be done: ::

    
    // Authentication and authorization already took place

    lock back end;

    create propfind request for <resource>;
    set Depth header to 0;
    send <propfind request> to back end;

    if ( <resource> exists )
    {
        expireLocks( <resource> );

        foreach ( <assigned lock> on <resource> )
        {
            if ( <assigned lock> is exclusive and If-header does not mention
                 <assigned lock> )
            {
                return <response 423 Locked>;
            }
        }

        if ( <resource> is a lock null resource )
        {
            delete <resource>;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        <parent> = get collection <resource>;
        create propfind request for <parent>;
        set Depth header to 0;
        send <propfind request> to back end;
        
        expireLocks( <parent> );

        foreach ( <assigned lock> on <parent> )
        {
            if ( <assigned lock> is exclusive and If-header does not mention
                 <assigned lock> )
            {
                return <response 423 Locked>;
            }
        }
    }

    remove If header from <request>;
    // Let back end perform <request> ...

    unlock back end;

GET / HEAD request
-------------------

The GET and HEAD methods are not directly affected by locks. Since we store
lock-null resources as normal resources and only add custom properties to them
for identification, GET/HEAD requests need to be intercepted. If they are
performed on a lock null resource, the method must fail. The following checks
are therefore needed (pseudo code): ::

    lock back end;

    create propfind request for <resource>;
    set Depth header to 0;
    send <propfind request> to back end;

    expireLocks( <resource> );

    foreach ( <assigned lock> on <resource> )
    {
        if ( <assigned lock> is exclusive and If-header does not mention
             <assigned lock> )
        {
            return <response 423 Locked>;
        }
    }

    // Let back end perform request

    unlock back end;

Lock null resources
===================

Lock null resources are not yet existing resources which have been already been
locked. The sense behind this is to lock a resource before it is created, to
ensure that no other principle can interfere with this creation. Lock null
resources may not appear as complete resources to the accessing clients, so
that the lock plugin must check under certain circumstances if an affected
resource is a lock null resource or not.

Lock null resources need to be persistent between requests as long as their
lock exists. As soon as this lock is removed or expires the lock null resource
must be removed, too. If the creation process on a lock null resource succeeds
it must be converted into a real resource.

To allow the lock plugin to distinguish between lock null resources and real
resources, a new dead property will be introduced in the dedicated name space
*ezclock*. In this name space the empty property *nullresource* will be used to
indicate that a resource is a lock null resource.

During a request the lock plugin needs to check responses for lock null
resources before they are serialized by the transport. Supported methods of
lock null resources are:

- PUT
- MKCOL
- OPTIONS
- PROPFIND
- LOCK
- UNLOCK

All other methods will return 405 (Method Not Allowed). For the PROPFIND
request, only certain properties are supported by lock null resources. These
are mainly the lockdiscovery and supportedlock properties, All other live
properties should be empty.

.. Note::
   The fact that lock null resource properties are mostly empty is not a MUST
   condition in the RFC, so we will leave most properties as set by the
   back end, to allow proper serialization on the transport layer.

Common concerns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes the design to realize support for the If-header, which
is used in WebDAV with combinations of entity tags and lock tokens.

It is not possibly to extract all parts of locking support into the lock
plugin, since the If-header must be parsed in one go. Since this can also
contain entity tags, which do belong into the main component, it cannot be
parsed exclusively in the lock plugin.

Transport layer
===============

The transport layer needs to parse the If-header.

.. Note::
   Since the header can contain entity tags and lock tokens, the parsing needs
   to take place inside ezcWebdavHeaderHandler itself and cannot be part of the
   plugin.
   
The If header is the most complex header that needed to be parsed so far. All
other parsed headers either contained a string value or a simply to process
other scalar value. To encapsulate the If header correctly some new classes
need to be invented which are described in following::

    abstract class ezcWebdavIfHeaderList implements ArrayAccess
    {
        protected ezcWebdavIfHeaderListItems[] $items;
    }

    class ezcWebdavIfHeaderTaggedList extends ezcWebdavIfHeaderList
    {
    }

    class ezcWebdavIfHeaderNoTagList extends ezcWebdavIfHeaderList
    {
    }

These classes represent the lists provided in an If-header. Both are accessed
through the ArrayAccess interface. The keys used to query the object are
resource paths (not URIs!).

An ezcWebdavIfHeaderList object will return an array of
ezcWebdavIfHeaderListItem objects on read access through ArrayAccess. This
array represents the OR concatenation of the items. The item class realizes the
OR combination and is described further below.

The ezcWebdavIfHeaderTaggedList will return the list items defined for the
resource path given via ArrayAccess and only those for the given path (an empty
array of none were defined for this path. In contrast to that,
ezcWebdavIfHeaderNoTagList will return all list items for *every* resource
path, since the lists applies to all resources.

This way of abstracting tagged lists and no-tag lists allows a unified usage of
both classes in deeper layers of the Webdav component (plugin or back end).

::

    class ezcWebdavIfHeaderListItem
    {
        public function __construct(
            array $lockTokens = array(),
            array $eTags      = array(),
            bool $negated     = false
        );

        property-read array $lockTokens;
        property-read array $eTags;
        property-read bool  $negated;
    }

An instance of this class represents a list item, which can combines several
entity tags ($eTag) and lock tokens ($lockTokens). In addition it can be
defined to be negated ($negated === true). The combination represented by such
an object is a logical AND combination. 

Code examples
-------------

Some small code examples to illustrate the above class design will be shown
here.

::

   COPY /resource1 HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.foo.bar
   Destination: http://www.foo.bar/resource2
   If: <http://www.foo.bar/resource1> (<locktoken:a-write-lock-token>
   [W/"A weak ETag"]) (["strong ETag"])
   <http://www.bar.bar/random>(["another strong ETag"])

This example shows a tagged list in the If header, which will be parsed into an
instance of ezcWebdavIfHeaderTaggedList will be created from it in the
Transport layer. The access to this object in the back end or the lock plugin
will look as follows: ::

    $res1items = $ifHeader['/resource1'];

    $res2items = $ifHeader['/resource2'];

    $randomItems = $ifHeader['/random'];

The $res1items variable will contain an array reflecting the conditions
specified for http://www.foo.bar/resource1. The $res2items variable will
contain an empty array since no conditions were defined for this resource.
While the $randomItems variable should normally not be requested (since the
resource is not affected) it would contain the corresponding list items for the
http://www.bar.bar/random resource.

In contrast, the following request would return an instance of
ezcWebdavIfHeaderNoTagList for the contained If header: ::

   COPY /resource1 HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.foo.bar
   Destination: http://www.foo.bar/resource2
   If: (<locktoken:a-write-lock-token> [W/"A weak ETag"]) (["strong ETag"])
   (["another strong ETag"])

Taking the same accesses to the corresponding $ifHeader variable as shown above
will result in all 3 variables containing the same values: All 3 list items
will be contained, since the If header does not use tagging to specify which
resources are affected by the conditions.

Server layer
============

If the lock plugin is active, it needs to hook into every affected request (see
affected base methods) and check the If header conditions. The check does
not only affect the checking of lock token conditions, but also the check of
entity tag validation, because both condition types are combinable. The checks are
performed via the receivedRequest hook of the plugin API.

The procedure (in pseudo code) is as follows: ::

    lock back end;
    foreach ( <range of affected resources> as <base resource> )
    {
        create propfind request for <base resource>;
        set request properties to <getetag> and <lockdiscovery>;
        set depth according to incoming request;
        send request to back end;
        foreach ( <resources in response> as <resource> )
        {
            if ( <resource> does not conform to If header )
            {
                return <precondition failed response>;
            }
        }
    }
    discard If header;
    unlock back end;

The If header needs to be discarded after correct validation of all entity
tag/lock token conditions. This avoids that the back end checks for the entity
tag conditions a second time.

.. Note::
   The checking of both (lock token and entity tag) conditions is necessary in
   this case, although it results in a small part of code-duplication.

.. Warning::
   The behaviour shown here does not conform to 100% with the WebDAV RFC,
   which states that the "If header is intended to have similar functionality
   to the If-Match header defined in section 14.25 of [RFC2068]". If this is
   taken literally, the lock plugin would need to check if a request would fail
   without the If header before checking the If header itself. This would
   result in unmanageable overhead and code duplication.

.. Warning::
   Actually the back end would have need to be locked completely, in case an If
   header occurred and was successfully checked by the lock plugin. This complete
   lock must be held until the corresponding response was created by the
   back end. Else there is a race condition in the time frame after the lock
   checking until the back end starts processing. This can lead to extremely
   strange results in high-load environments.

Back end layer
==============

The back end receives the parsed If header as described in the Transport
layer section through the $headers property of the request object. We cannot
enforce the honoring of the If header, so back ends do not necessarily honor
them. However, it should be properly documented that this header exists and is
must be honored if shipped with a request.

If a back end takes care for the header, it may only use the $eTag and $negated
properties and must ignore the $lockTokens property. The latter one is used
exclusively in the lock plugin. In case the lock plugin is active, the back end
should never receive any If header. The If header will then be processed
exclusively by the lock plugin.

If the back end pays attention to the If header, it must honor it for every
request and every resource path that is accessed during execution of the
request. To include the checking of the If header into request processing the
following algorithm must be used (pseudo-code): ::

    lock back end;
    if ( preconditions for request without If header are not fulfilled )
    {
        return <corresponding error response>;
    }
    foreach ( <affected resources> as <resource> )
    {
        if ( If header not fulfilled for <resource> )
        {
            return <precondition failed error response>;
        }
    }
    process request;
    unlock back end;
    return <corresponding response>;


The back end does not need to take care of If headers, if the lock plugin is
installed. In this case, the lock plugin will take over the complete check for
the If headers conditions and remove the header from the request object
afterwards.

Infrastructure
==============

The ezcWebdavRequest class does currently not support the removal of headers as
required by the lock plugin. A method ::
    
    public removeHeader( $headerName )

needs therefore to be added. This method also needs to invalidate the headers
internally in the class, so that a manual revalidation using validateHeaders()
needs to occur. Since the lock plugin will remove the If header before the
request object passes ezcWebdavServer, the headers are validated anyways there.
