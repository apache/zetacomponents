Review of MvcTools-1.0-alpha at 26.11.08
========================================

API

- The abstract class ezcMvcRouter contains a methods, which I do not really
  understand:

  - The static public method prefix() is not used or referenced anywhere
    else in that class

- Make ezcMvcResult an interface or do not already implement any final
  methods. If some properties are required, there should be an extensible
  method for it. Otherwise this strongly limits the extensibility.

  The $status property still seems not really important / used to me.

- The interface ezcMvcViewHandler does not define the method createResponse()
  called by the ezcMvcConfigurableDispatcher implementation, but other
  methods, which indicate a template based usage, which may not be wanted in
  case of, for example, XML creation. It should only enforce the
  createResponse() method.

- The ezcMvcResponse::$status variable needs better documentation, its purpose
  is at least unclear to me. The check in
  MvcTools/src/response_writers/http.php +61 probably should be changed to
  is_object(), otherwise values like "null" cause PHP errors there.

- Initialize status with 0, even when the constructor is not called - if this
  property really is required.

Documentation
-------------

- Didn't we agree to document parameters in teh method description and not
  behind the parameter, like in MvcTools/src/interfaces/route.php +25?

- The purpose behind ezcMvcRoute::prefix() is not obvious to me from the
  documentation.

  And I don't think the prefixing could fix all the issues, which occur
  regarding prefixes of controller paths (application in subdirectory, running
  inside a PHAR, using mod_rewrite, ..)

  I actually remove the prefix in the HttpParser (script name, subdir, ..) and
  pass the basePath and the sanitized URI around. Using this inside the
  templates should solve most issues.

- The documentation in ezcMvcHttpRequestParser is incomplete.

- The return value documentation of
  arbitDispatcherConfiguration::runPreRoutingFilters() is wrong and should be:
  @return ezcMvcRequest. Using the currently documented return value breaks
  the main loop in ezcMvcConfigurableDispatcher.

Trivial, maybe irrelevant
-------------------------

ezcMvcConfigurableDispatcher
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Increase $redirects at begin of loop, reduces redundancy and makes it less
  error prone if somebody extends / changes the code.

- Even 25 should be save, make the maximum internal redirects configurable?
