eZ Components - Translation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Introduction
============

Many web applications require the use of translated GUI elements. There are
several traditional ways of providing this functionality, but none of them are
particularly easy to use or maintain. The Translation component provides
functionality for retrieving translated data through multiple (extendable)
backends and for filtering translatable data. It also allows translated strings
with parameters; as a result, it is possible to use different word orders in
different languages while still utilizing the parameters correctly.

Dependencies
============

This component has an optional dependency on the Cache component by means of
the TranslationCacheTiein component. When the latter is installed, the
Translation system can make use of a cache for the storage and retrieval of
data.

The Template component also has an optional dependency on this component, by
means of the TemplateTranslationTiein component. This component adds a template
function that uses the Translation component to fetch translated data.

Class overview
==============

ezcTranslationManager
  This is the main class of this component. It is responsible for calling the
  configured backends to read translation data and return a translation
  context in the form of an ezcTranslation object.

ezcTranslationCacheBackend, ezcTranslationTsBackend
  These classes implement backends that read data from a specific source.
  ezcTranslationTsBackend reads its data from `Qt's Linguist files`_ - an
  XML-based format for storing original text and translated text. The
  ezcTranslationCacheBackend handler reads translation data through the Cache
  mechanism.

ezcTranslation
  Objects of this class are returned by the ezcTranslationManager::getContext()
  method. ezcTranslationManager uses the backend's getContext() method to
  retrieve data. 

ezcTranslationComplementEmptyFilter
  This class implements a filter that substitutes a missing ("unfinished") translated string
  with its untranslated source. This filter makes sure that all translatable
  strings return some text, even if a particular string has not been translated yet.
  
ezcTranslationBorkFilter, ezcTranslationLeetFilter
  These two classes serve as examples on how to implement filters. Aside from
  serving as examples, they have very little function.

Basic usage
===========

In the simplest case, your application only needs to access
translated versions of the strings that it uses. In most cases, the strings used
in an application will be in English, but of course that is not always the case. In the
first version of this component, we only support `Qt's Linguist files`_ (TS
files) which group translatable strings together in contexts. The TS file
format is handled by the ezcTranslationTsBackend class. This backend requires
one setting (the location to find the translation) and has one option
(the format for the filename for each locale). 

In the first example, we assume that all translations are stored in the
"translations/" directory, and that the filename consists of "translation-"
followed by the locale name with the suffix ".xml". The locale name itself is a freeform
field, but we recommend to use the `ISO639-1`_ language code, followed by a _
(underscore), followed by the ISO3166_ country code. For example, use nb_NO.xml for
Bokmål/Norway or nl_BE.xml for Dutch/Belgium.

.. include:: tutorial_example_01.php
   :literal:

In the above example we create a backend object in lines 4 and 5. We tell the
backend where to find the translations and the format of the translation
filename. The string "[LOCALE]" will automatically be replaced with the
locale name when the translation file is opened. With the configured backend, we
then construct a manager in line 7. In lines 8 and 9 we instruct the manager to
return the contexts "tutorial/headers" and "tutorial/descriptions" for the
"nb_NO" locale. When the manager retrieves the content, it first
checks its internal cache to determine whether the ezcTranslation object for that context was
already retrieved. If the object for the context is available in the cache, it
will simply return the ezcTranslation object. If the context is not in the
cache, it will defer the retrieving to the backend, store the results in its
cache and return the context.

Parameterized strings
=====================

In many cases, there are parameters to your translated strings, for example to
fill in the name of an article. In this case, a solution would be to separate the
translatable string into two parts, then concatenate them together with the
parameter in the correct place. However, it is also possible that the order of
parameters changes when you translate a string. For example the
English string "Search for 'appelmoes' returned 3 matches" can be translated in Dutch
as: "Er zijn 3 items gevonden bij het zoeken naar 'appelmoes'". The simple
concatenation mechanism would no longer work. Luckily, the Translation
component supports parameterized strings in two different ways: with
numerical replacement identifiers (such as %1 and %2) and with associative
identifiers (such as %search_string and %matches). The following example
illustrates how this is done.

.. include:: tutorial_example_02.php
   :literal:

The first lines are the same as in the previous example. In this case, however, we retrieve
an ezcTranslation object for the same context for two different locales (in
line 8 and 9). In lines 11 and 12, we request the translation for "Search for
'%search_string' returned %matches matches.". This sentence has two parameters
(search_string and matches) for which the values are provided in an array. The
array is passed as the second parameter to the getTranslation() method.

The translation for the English "The apple is round" in Norwegian is "Applet er
rund". With the name of the fruit being the parameter, you can see that in
Norwegian the parameter value needs to have its first letter uppercased, since
it begins a sentence. The translation system supports this by
specifying the first letter of the parameter name in the translated string as a
capital letter. In TS format, this would be as follows: ::

    <source>The %fruit is round.</source>
    <translation>%Fruit er rund.</translation>

When the first letter of a parameter name in the translated string is a
capital, the translation system will also make the first letter of the
parameter value uppercase. The output of the whole script is therefore: ::

    Er zijn 4 items gevonden bij het zoeken naar 'appelmoes'.
    Epplet er rund.

Filters
=======

In some cases, not all of the translation files are up to date. For example, the
original translation file might be updated with new strings, but the translator
has not had the time to translate the strings yet. For your application to show
at least the original strings (often in English) the Translation component uses filters.
Filters are applied after the backend retrieves the data, but before it is placed
in the internal cache of the manager. 

.. include:: tutorial_example_03.php
   :literal:

In this example, we add a filter to the manager in line 8. In
line 9, we then request translation for a string that is marked as "unfinished".
The ezcTranslationComplementEmptyFilter filter fills in the original string for
every translation that is still marked as "unfinished".

There are a few extra (but less useful) filters in the Translation component.
The next example shows the "Leet" and "Bork" filters in action. The Bork
filter mangles non-finished or non-translated text so that it is obvious which
text is translatable but not yet translated. The "Leet" filter renders your
text using Leetspeak_. Both filters are demonstrated in the following example:

.. include:: tutorial_example_03b.php
   :literal:

Lines 4 to 8 show the usage of ezcTranslationBorkFilter and lines 10 to 14
show the usage of ezcTranslationLeetFilter. The output of this script is::

    header1
    [Seerch for 'appelmoes' retoorned 4 metches.]
    3r zijn 4 i73ms g3v0nd3n bij h37 z03k3n n44r 'appelmoes'.

The first line is "header1" because this script includes the previous one. For
the Bork filter you can see that it uses the original string and not the
translated version. The Leet filter however uses the translated string
exclusively. In case you want to implement your own filters, you need to create
a class that implements the ezcTranslationFilter interface. Have a look at the
implementation for the ezcTranslationBorkFilter filter, which shows how to
implement such a class.

Iteration
=========

In some situations it might be useful to iterate over all the contexts in a
specific translation file. The backends that implement the
ezcTranslationContextRead interface provide this functionality in the form of
an iterator. The ezcTranslationTsBackend is such a class. Using this interface
is extremely easy, as you will see in the next example.

.. include:: tutorial_example_04.php
   :literal:

In line 7, we initialize the reader with the locale "nb_NO". After this is done,
we can simply use foreach() to loop over all the contexts in the translation
definition (in lines 9 to 17).


Caching
=======

Reading from an XML file for every translation context is not very fast -
especially when the translation file has a lot of strings. Thus, the translation
system benefits from a caching solution. Caching is implemented in the Cache_
component and the links between this component and the caching component are
implemented in ezcTranslationCacheBackend_ from the
TranslationCacheTiein_ component.

Using the cache backend is similar to using the Ts backend, as is shown in
the next example:

.. include:: tutorial_example_05.php
   :literal:

Instead of setting up the Ts backend, we have to instantiate
ezcCacheStorageFileArray (line 4), which we then pass as the sole parameter to
the constructor of ezcTranslationCacheBackend_ (line 5). Lines 7 to 13 are
exactly the same as in the first example.

When you try to run this script an ezcTranslationContextNotAvailableException
exception is thrown because we did not put any contents in the cache yet.
ezcTranslationCacheBackend_ implements the ezcTranslationContextWrite
interface. Using that, combined with a class that implements the ezcTranslationContextRead
interface (such as ezcTranslationTsBackend), you can fill the cache in a
memory efficient way. The next example demonstrates how this is done. 

.. include:: tutorial_example_06.php
   :literal:

In lines 4 to 6 we set up the reader interface, like we did in the previous 
example. Then we continue in lines 8 to 10 to initialize the writer. You
should keep the locale for both the reader and writer the same. In line 12, we
use a foreach() loop to iterate over all the contexts through the
reader interface. We use the ezcTranslationContextWrite::storeContext()
method in line 14 to store the retrieved context object to the cache. After we
iterate over all the contexts and store them, we initialize the reader and
writer in lines 17-18. After you run this script, the script from the previous
example would also work (as the cache now has all the contexts).

Manipulating translation files
==============================

It is possible to use the Translation component to modify translation files in
the Linguist format as well. The TS backend implements the
ezcTranslationContextWrite interface as well. Modifications happen on context
level, which means it is not possible right now to remove whole contexts from
the translation files. Updating and adding strings to a context, as well as
adding a whole new context is supported. To show how to do this, we take the
following TS file as starting point:

.. include:: translations/mod-example-nl_NL.xml
   :literal:

And use the following script to update it:

.. include:: tutorial_example_07.php
   :literal:

After running, the output is::

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <!DOCTYPE TS>
    <TS>
      <context>
        <name>existing</name>
        <message>
          <source>added</source>
          <translation>toegevoeg</translation>
          <comment>comment</comment>
        </message>
        <message>
          <source>update with new translation</source>

        <message>
          <source>update translation</source>

        </message>
        <message>
          <source>to obsolete</source>
          <translation type="obsolete">markeren als ongebruikt</translation>
        </message>
      </context>
      <context>
        <name>new</name>
        <message>
          <source>new string</source>
          <translation>nieuwe string</translation>
        </message>
      </context>
    </TS>
