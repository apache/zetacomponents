Introduction
============

Description
-----------

Interactive data points describe a feature in charts, that the viewer of the
chart can interactively get more information about data, when viewing the
chart, or moving his mouse pointer over points of interest in the chart.

Requirements
============

There are two major sets of features to implement

Value indication
----------------

The value indication means, that at the position of the mouse pointer lines
are drawn, depeding on the chart type, to indicate the current data value at
this poistion in the chart. In a line chart this would mean a horizontal and a
vertical line to the axis and some coordinate information at the current
position of the mouse pointer, while in radar chart a line to the center of
the chart and an ellipse, indicating the value on the y axis, needs to be
drawn.

To enable this an option will be added to the driver option classes for the
drivers, which are capeable of drawing this. The value indication will be off
by default and can be enabled like this:

::

	$chart->driver->options->valueIndication = true;

This option will be defined in the driver classes for the drivers implementing
the ezcGraphDriverValueIndication interface. We cannot add those options to
ezcGraphDriverOptions, because not all drivers will support this new feature,
and implementing an interface in the driver option class makes no sense, as no
methods, but only properties, will be added. The configure options will be
delegated to an option class ezcGraphDriverValueIndicationOptions to have a
central unique place to maintain those options.

Driver support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The driver itself needs to implement a new interface which defines the methods
required to add the interactive elements to the resulting image. The renderer
will call those methods on the driver if it implements the interface.

::
	interface ezcGraphDriverValueIndication
	{
		/***
		 * Add value indication for a cartesian coordinate system
		 *
		 * The graph data is rendered in the bounding box, the x values to
		 * indicate start with $xStart up to $xEnd, and the y values start
		 * with $yStart, up to $yEnd.
		 *
		 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate
		 *
		 * @param ezcGraphBoundings $box
		 * @param float $xStart
		 * @param float $xEnd
		 * @param float $yStart
		 * @param float $yEnd
		 * return void
		 */
		public function cartesianValueIndication(
			ezcGraphBoundings $box, 
			$xStart, 
			$xEnd, 
			$yStart, 
			$yEnd
		);

		/***
		 * Add value indication for a polar coordinate system
		 *
		 * The graph data is rendered in the bounding box, the x values to
		 * indicate start with $xStart up to $xEnd, and the y values start
		 * with $yStart, up to $yEnd. The middle point of the polar coordinate
		 * system is always the center point of the bounding box. The zero
		 * angle may be rotated, depending on the graph rotation.
		 *
		 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate
		 *
		 * @param ezcGraphBoundings $box
		 * @param float $xStart
		 * @param float $xEnd
		 * @param float $yStart
		 * @param float $yEnd
		 * return void
		 */
		public function polarValueIndication(
			ezcGraphBoundings $box, 
			$xStart, 
			$xEnd, 
			$yStart, 
			$yEnd
		);
	}

Additional data point information
---------------------------------

When hovering or clicking on a data point or a legenda item, a box with 
additional information should be displayed. The box should contain text or
user defined content.

The data will be associated with the data point the same way we now associate
URLs, by an additional option, so that you can optionally add information when
creating your chart. This will consume nearly no memory if this feature is not
used.

::

	$chart->data['data'] = new DataSet();
	$chart->data['data']->informationBox['key'] = $object;

You may of course set the informationBox property without specifying a special
data set key to set it for all data points of a data set, even it may not make 
sense semantically.

The value defined in the informationBox property will be passed to the driver.
The driver classes do not need to implement additional public methods for
this, but may optionally use an extended version of the ezcGraphContext 
structure, which is already used to pass semantical context of rendered image 
primitives to the driver. This struct will be extended by the additional
optional property $informationBox.

The type of $object cannot be checked before the graph is actually rendered,
or the scripts for the data point information are created, because it
rigorously depends on the driver, which values are accepted here.

- The ming driver accepts SWFMovie, SWFSprite and SWFShape objects.
- The SVG driver accepts XML, which should be valid SVG, which we won't check
  for performance reasons.
- The GD driver will use enhanced imagemaps with JavaScript, so it will accept
  IDs of HTML elements of the document the image will be embedded in. The
  element may contain arbitrary content and will get an absolut poistion and
  moved in front of the chart image.

The driver classes do not need to implement additional public methods to make
use of the new informationBox property, but can just check the context struct,
if it is available and render it properly then.

The gd driver can of course not natively support this, because bitmaps may not
contain any active content. An additional method createInteractiveImageMap()
will be added to the ezcGraphTools class. This may be called, or the user can
implement the JavaScript itself, to not infere with his own scripting
mechanisms.
