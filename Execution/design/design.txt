Design Description
==================
The component uses the register_shutdown_function() and set_execution_handler()
to allow the catching of fatal errors and uncatched exceptions. At the start of
the script you need to initialize the execution environment and when your
application is done executing you signal the component that you have a "clean
exit".  In case there was not a clean exit the shutdown handler will pick up
and call your defined callback handler to display the error message.

There are two classes in this component:

ezcExecution
------------
This class provides methods to intialize the class (with a static method) and
to signal clean and unclean exists.

ezcExecutionBasicErrorHandler
-----------------------------
This class implements a default handler that can be used and extended for use
with the execution framework.

Algorithms
==========

The following example shows how to utilize these classes: ::

    <?php
        class myExecutionHandler extends ezcExecutionBasicErrorHandler
        {
            public function onError( $exception = NULL )
            {
                echo "Error!\n";
                parent::onError( $exception );
            }
        }

        ezcExecution::init( 'myExecutionHandler' );

        ....
        
        ezcExecution::cleanExit();
    ?>

   Local Variables:
   mode: rst
   fill-column: 79
   End:
   vim: et syn=rst tw=79
