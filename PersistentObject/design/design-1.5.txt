Scope
=====

The scope of this document is to describe the proposed enhancements for the
PersistentObject component version 1.5.

The general goal for this version is to implement various features
described by these issues in our issue tracker:

- Select query decorator.
- #12473: Identity map for PersistentObject.
- #13074: Fetching related objects through joins.
- #13073: Sub-select support for PersistentObject.
- #11831: isRelated() Method.
- #13170: Support for custom relation implementations.

Each of the issues and their proposed solutions are explained in a separate
chapter in this document. Some issues relate to each other, which is also
explained in the issue descriptions. The requirements for each of the
enhancements can be found in the corresponding requirements document.

======================
Select query decorator
======================

The initial design of the PersistentObject component defined the following code
flow to create a find query for certain objects and fetch the desired objects::

    <?php
    $query = $session->createFindQuery( 'SomeClass' );

    $query->where( /*...*/ );
    
    $objects = $session->find( $query, 'SomeClass' );
    ?>

The class name of the objects to fetch is actually submitted twice to the
ezcPersistentSession instance. This is uncomfortable for the user of the
component and should be solved by a custom decorator for the SELECT query
classes provided by the Database component.

The idea is to create a wrapper class for the (database specific)
ezcQuerySelect instance that is returned by
ezcPersistentSession->createFindQuery(). This decorator class will dispatch all
method and attribute accesses to the internal query class, but also accepts
further meta information from the ezcPersistentSession instance it was created
by.

------
Design
------

The basic decorator class (ezcPersistentFindQuery) will consist only of a
constructor that adds a single virtual property $className as meta data to the
query::

    public function __construct( ezcQuerySelect $q, string $className );

All further method calls are delegate to the given $q object using __call().
The same applies for property and attribute accesses, except for the $className
property.

The resulting code for user will be simplified as follows::

    <?php
    $query = $session->createFindQuery( 'SomeClass' );

    $query->where( /*...*/ );
    
    $objects = $session->find( $query );
    ?>

Since the decorated query class is completly transparent to the user, the old
code will still work as expected, maintaining backwards compatibility.

Further enhancements of the PersistentObject component may enhance
ezcPersistentFindQuery by extending the class. It is mandatory that these
extensions maintain BC with ezcQuerySelect for all methods that already exist
in ezcPersistentSession.

=================================
Identity map for PersistentObject
=================================

The Identity Map pattern is described by Martin Fowler in his book `Patterns of
Enterprise Application Architecture`__. The purpose of this pattern is to avoid
that 2 or more objects representing the same database row reside in memory. The
problems here are:

a) Duplicate memory consumption
b) Potential inconsistencies between different copies of the same object.

.. __: http://martinfowler.com/books.html#eaa

To avoid this, the data manipulation mechanisms must take care of not
delivering duplicate instances of the same data. Beside that, it can cache
certain queries as long as manipulations are reflected properly. The data
manipulation mechanisms in our case are realized in the ezcPersistentSession
and related (internal) handler classes.

------
Design
------

The Identity Map support should be optional to not break BC and keep
flexibility. Therefore, a new class named ezcPersistentIdentityMapSession is
implemented. This extends the current implementation ezcPersistentSession to
make instanceof checks still work. All of the methods will be overwritten and
new handler classes, extending the existing ones will be implemented to reflect
the actual additions.

The following list gives an overview of classes to be implemented and their
role in this design:

- ezcPersistentIdentitySession

  This class is a decorator to the existing ezcPersistentSession. An object of
  this class wraps around the typically used persistence session and adds the
  desired functionality to it. Database related method calls are still
  performed using the original ezcPersistentSession instance.

- ezcPersistentIdentityMap
  
  An instance of this class builds the heart of ezcPersistentIdentitySession.
  It takes care for the in-memory management of object identities. The instance
  used by ezcPersistentIdentitySession is replaceable, to allow custom
  implementations like e.g. an identity map that uses the Cache component
  instead of local memory.

- ezcPersistentIdentitySessionOptions

  This class is the options storage for ezcPersistentIdentitySession.

The following sections describe the implemented classes in further detail.

ezcPersistentIdentitySession
============================

This main class of the enhancement will be used exactly like
ezcPersistentSession and realizes the desired functionality completely
transparent to the user. This allows users to transparently replace the old
version and vise versa. The class will moddel a decorator for the existing
ezcPersistentSession.

Functionality
-------------

The constructor of the class receives an ezcPersistentSession instance to
decorate and an object of type ezcPersistentIdentityMap, which realizes the
identity mapping itself. This central point is used as the cache for object
identities. All method calls, that are affected as described in the
requirements document, will utilize this object to grab cached object
identities and to reflect their changes.

ezcPersistentIdentitySession will implement the same methods as
ezcPersistentSession and perform the necessary cache inserts, updates and
lookups around it. The following methods cannot be traced correctly and may
therefore lead to inconsistencies:

- createUpdateQuery()
- updateFromQuery()
- createDeleteQuery()
- deleteFromQuery()

The use of the \*FromQuery() methods will therefore result in a complete purge
of the identity map to ensure consistency.

Interface
---------

__construct( ezcPersistentSession $session, ezcPersistentIdentityMap $map )
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The constructor receives the persistent $session to dispatch method calls to.
In addition it receives the identity $map object to cache and retrieve object
identities with.

Both instances can be replaced by custom extensions of the original
implementation to add further functionality.

load( string $class, mixed $id )
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case the requested object is found in the identity map, it will be returned
from there. Otherwise the decorated persistent session will issue a normal
load() operation and the result will be recorded in the identity map.
loadIfExists() will react the same way.

loadIntoObject( object $object, mixed $id )
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case the given $object already is a loaded instance of an object, an
exception will be thrown. If the desired object with the $id was already
recorded in the identity map, an exception is thrown, too, since the operation
would result in a copy. Otherwise the load is performed as desired and the
resulting object instance is recorded and returned.

find( ezcQuerySelect $query, $class )
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ezcPersistentSession->find() is executed. In the resulting array, each object
is checked in the identity map. If an identity is found, it is replaced into
the result. If the identity of the object is not yet knowen, it is recorded.

Since the new ezcPersistentFindQuery class will be introduced with this
release, the optional $class parameter will be deprecated, but kept for BC
reasons.

It is possible to disable the identity caching globally, using the $refetch
option.  In this case, identities will be updated, before they are fetched from
the identity map. 2 cases must be differntiated here:

1. The identity is not found in the identity map.
   
   In this case, the identity will be cretaed as usual.

2. The identity is found in the identity map.

   In this case, the loaded data will be used to update the existing identity
   (as ezcPersistentSession->refresh() would do) and the updated identity will
   be returned.

findIterator( ezcQuerySelect $query, string $class )
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To support this method properly, a new class ezcPersistentIdenitiyFindIterator
is introduced. This one decorates the ezcPersistentFindIterator returned by
ezcPersistentSession->findIterator(). The decorating class will take care of
modelling the same behavior as described above with the find() method.

getRelatedObjects( object $object, $relatedClass, $relationName = null )
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This method checks the relation cache of the identity map first, if a result
set has already been stored for the given relation. In this case the cached
result set will be returned.

If the $refetch option is switched to true, the set of related objects will not
be fetched from the identity map, but loaded from the database directly. If a
result set already exists in memory, it will be replaced by the newly fetched
set.

The object identities themselves are handled as described in the find() method,
including the behaviour of the $refetch option.

getRelatedObject( object $object, $relatedClass, $relationName = null )
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Same as above, only for a single object.

save( object $object )
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Whenever a new object was saved successfully, it is recorded in the identity
map.

saveOrUpdate( object $object )
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This method reacts the same as save() if the operation was not an update. In
case of an update nothing is to do, since the object is already part of the
identity map.

addRelatedObject( object $sourceObject, object $relatedObject )
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This method performs the usually operation of ezcPersistentSession. In
addition, the following operations will be performed:

If the $relatedObject was already related to another object, it is removed from
the relation cache. The new relation is reflected accordingly in the relation
cache.

.. note::
   It should be discussed if it is feasible to perform the save() operation
   after a newly established relation automatically here, since otherwise
   inconsistencies might occur with the mapping cache. ezcPersistentSession
   does not do this, to avoid multiple UPDATE queries. Maybe a global switch in
   ezcPersistentSession to activate this overall might be sensible?

delete( object $object )
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This method must remove all references to the object from all mapping caches
before actually deleting the object itself from the DB. This is the most time
consuming work, since multiple isset() calls might be necessary to remove all
identities from the relation cache.

.. note::
   The delete() operation also removes all relations and, if cascading is used,
   also removes related objects. Therefore the operation might even run longer.

Performance should be a major concern when writing this code.

removeRelatedObject( object $sourceObject, object $relatedObject, string $relationName = null )
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Beside removing the relation from the DB (in case of n:m relations), using
ezcPersistentSession->removeRelatedObject(), the relation is removed from the
relation cache, too.

.. note::
   It should be discussed if it is feasible to perform the save() operation
   after a newly established relation automatically here, since otherwise
   inconsistencies might occur with the mapping cache. ezcPersistentSession
   does not do this, to avoid multiple UPDATE queries. Maybe a global switch in
   ezcPersistentSession to activate this overall might be sensible?

ezcPersistentIdenitySessionOptions
==================================

The new ezcPersistentIdentitySession can be configured to switch on and off
certain features. The options are:

$refetch = false;
  Setting this to true will make the identity map indicate that no results have
  been cached, yet. The result is, that the persistent session will re-fetch
  all objects and record them in the identity map. This also affects the
  relation cache ($refetchRelations = true).

ezcPersistentIdentityMap
========================

This class is the internal heart of the identity map enhancement. It handles
all caching and mapping activities globally for a session.

Users shall usually not access the identity map object directly to fetch cached
objects or add new ones. On the other hand, the identity map should be
replaceable to allow more advanced implementations (e.g. involving the Cache
component). Therefore most methods of this class will public, but marked as
proteced via documentation.

Functionality
-------------

The following 2 areas of identity mapping will be handled:

1. The identity mapping itself.

   In this cache, each persistent object that is available in the session is
   recorded once. The mapping is::

        array(
            <class_name> => array(
                <id_value> => <object>,
                <id_value> => <object>,
                <id_value> => <object>,
                // ...
            ),
            // ...
        )

   The <object> values here are structs of type ezcPersistentIdentity, which
   store the object identity and some meta data and the relations cache in
   addition.

2. The relation mapping.

   The relations of an object are stored in its ezcPersistentIdentity struct.
   See the specific section of this document for further details.

Interface
---------

The following methods will be provided by the ezcPersistentIdentityMap class:

- addIdentity( object $object )

  Adds a new object to the identity map. If the object already exists in the
  map, an exception is throwen.

- getObject( string $class, mixed $id )

  Returns the object recorded for $class, identified by $id. If such object is
  not available, null is returned.

- replaceIdentity( object $object )
  
  Adds the object to the map, if it does not exist, yet. If it already exists,
  the values of the existing identity are replaced by the values of $object.
  The cached identity is returned in both cases.

- addRelatedObjects( object $sourceObject, array $relatedObjects, string $relationName = null )

  This method creates a related object result set for the given $object, which
  can be obtained later by getRelatedObjects(). In case the relation already
  exists in the identity map, an exception is thrown.

- replaceRelatedObjects( object $sourceObject, array $relatedObjects, string $relationName = null )

  This method works similar to replaceIdentity(). In case the relation set does
  not exist in the session, it is added as if addRelatedObjects() was used. If
  the relation set does exist, the original set is replaced with the new one.

- addRelatedObject( object $sourceObject, object $relatedObject )

  Appends a related object to an existing cached relation. Used in
  ezcPersistentIdentitySession->addRelatedObject().
  
  If no relation result set has been cached, yet, it is not created, but the
  call is ignored. This results in a newly fetch of the relation when
  getRelatedObjects() is called.

- removeRelatedObject( object $sourceObject, object $relatedObject )

  Removes a related object from the relation cache. Used in
  ezcPersistentIdentitySession->removeRelatedObject(). If the relation
  resultset is not cached, yet, the call is ignored.

- getRelatedObjects( object $sourceObject, string $class )

  Returns an array of objects of type $class related to $sourceObject. This can
  also be an empty array, if the last lookup in the database resulted in such.
  In case no related objects have been recorded, yet, null is returned.

- reset()

  Resets the complete identity map to its original state, purging all related
  objects and relation result sets.

-----------
Open issues
-----------

- Since ezcPersistentIdentitySession only decorates ezcPersistentSessions, it
  is not seamlessly possible to replace both in an application: Instanceof
  checks will not work.
- loadIfExists() can return null. Should this result be cached or should the
  method try to load again if no object has been loaded successfully, yet?

- The update() method only allows to update 1 specific object right now. This
  results in a lot of select queries, if multiple objects need to be updated.
  We should allow arrays of objects here and update them in a row using <id> IN
  ( ... ).

======================================
Fetching related objects through joins
======================================

Relation management with Persistent Objects is very convenient and powerful.
However, it suffers from one of the common consequences of such methods: the
amount of SQL queries you end up executing.

Since using relations is easy, you will easily end up running dozens or hundreds
of SQL queries, especially when using the templates component::

	{$event->location->name}

Very convenient, but this will run at least one extra query here; if you do this
when listing, let's say events, you will execute one extra query for each event
you display the location for. If you also display the event's responsible name,
it's another query. If you show 10 events, you execute 21 queries, and this is
not acceptable.

------
Design
------

A precondition of the pre-fetching of related objects is that these objects can
be stored internally in the persistent session somehow and can be accessed by
the user. The section `Identity map for PersistentObject`_ already describes
suche a mechanism in detail. Therefore, the pre-fetching feature will be
implemented inside the defined `ezcPersistentIdentitySession`_ class to utilize
this features.

The additions also affect the `ezcPersistentIdentityMap`_ class in some ways,
to allow the fetching of a subset of related objects.

API additions for ezcPersistentIdentitySession
==============================================

The ezcPersistentIdentitySession (originally described in the `Identity map for
PersistentObject`_ section) will be enhanced by methods to perform the
following operations:


- Load a persistent object including specific related objects.
- Finding persistent objects including specific related objects.
- Loading a persistent including a subset of related objects.
- Finding persistent objects including a subset of related objects.

To achieve this, the following methods will be added:

loadWithRelatedObjects( string $class, mixed $id, ezcPersistentRelationFindDefinition $relations )
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This method takes care about finding a speicifc persistent object (like the
ezcPersistentSession->load() method) and finds related objects in addition. The
$relations parameter contains a struct, defining the related objects to load.

createFindQueryWithRelations( string $class, ezcPersistentRelationFindDefinition $relations )
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This method works like ezcPersistentSession->createFindQuery() and returns a
query object, that may be manipulated by the user. The returned instance is of
type ezcPersistentFindWithRelationsQuery, which is a decorator for
ezcQuerySelect, which extends `ezcPersistentFindQuery`_, defined earlier in
this document. Aliases for $class are defined as known from createFindQuery().
For the related objects not aliases are set and the necessary JOINs are not yet
part of the query.

The query objects contains additional information about the $relations to
fetch, which will be used by the findWithRelations() method to define the
necessary JOINs and parse the returned objects.

The object can be handled like an instance of ezcPersistentFindQuery (aka
ezcQuerySelect), except that is does not allow to perform additional JOIN
operations. If the user tries to perform a JOIN, an exception is thrown. The
use of the limit() method on this object can result in unexpected behavior,
since it does not limit the number of persistent object of type $class, but the
overall number of rows fetched. Therefore the use of limit() also throws na
exception.

This behavioral change is necessary to avoid conflicts when adding the JOIN
statements to find related objects and to avoid that the user limits the
related object result sets. A query generated with this method will allways
fetch **all** related objects for the persistent objects found for the query.
To only fetch a subset of related objects, the method
createFindQueryWithRelationSubset() must be used.

findWithRelations( ezcPersistentFindWithRelationsQuery $query )
---------------------------------------------------------------

This method returns an array of objects exactly like
ezcPersistentSession->find() does. In the background, it adds the necessary
JOINs to the submitted $query object and fetches the related objects defined in
the query.

The related objects are stored in the relation cache of the
ezcPersistentIdentitySession and can be retrieved by the user through
ezcPersistentIdentitySession->getRelatedObjects().

createFindQueryWithRelationSubset( string $class, ezcPersistentRelationFindDefinition $relations )
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This method behaves almost like createFindQueryWithRelations(). In contrast to
this one, it returns a query object of type
ezcPersistentFindWithRelationSubsetQuery. The instance of this class already
has all JOINs defined. In addition it contains aliases for $class as well as
the relations. The user can manipulate the WHERE condition (as well as ODER BY
and LIMIT) on this object as he likes. This includes defining a subset of
objects to fetch, which is not possible using the query object returned by
createFindQueryWithRelations().

The query object returned by this class can be used with the method
findWithRelationSubset() to fetch the desired objects and their related
objects.

findWithRelationSubset( ezcPersistentFindWithRelationSubsetQuery $query, string $setName )
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This method works similar to the findWithRelations() method, but on the query
object created by createFindQueryWithRelationSubset(). The method fetches the
objects defined by the $query ($class) as well as the related objects defined
by the $query ($relations). Since the user can limit the related objects to be
fetched by this query, he needs to provide a $setName to identify this specific
subset of objects.

Relation subsets fetched with this method will not be available via the
getRelatedObjects() method directly. The reason for this is, that
getRelatedObjects() is expected to return the full set of related objects and
not just a subset. Instead the method getRelatedObjectsSubset() must be used to
access the named subset.

getRelatedObjectsSubset( object $object, string $relatedClass, string $setName, string $relationName = null )
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This method works similar to getRelatedObjects(), but allows to access a subset
of related objects, fetched using findWithRelationSubset().

API additions for ezcPersistentIdentityMap
==========================================

Some of the additions to `ezcPersistentIdentitySession`_ (defined earlier in
this section) require additions to the persistent session itself, too. The
identity map must be extended to be capable of managing named subsets of
related objects. The following methods are added:

addRelationSubset( object $sourceObject, array $relatedObjects, string $setName, string $relationName = null )
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This method acts like addRelatedObjects() but adds the relation set as a named
subset of relations. If the subset already exists, an exception is thrown.

replaceRelationSubset( object $sourceObject, array $relatedObjects, string $setName, string $relationName = null )
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
