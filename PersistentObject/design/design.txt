eZ publish Enterprise Component: Persistent Object, Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction
============

Purpose of Persistent Object package
------------------------------------

The purpose of the Persistent Object class is to provide the means to store an
object to a database in a transparent manner. The idea is to be able to quickly
develop "objects" that should be stored to the database without having to write
SQL calls compatible with all databases etc.

Current implementation
----------------------

Currently Persistent Object functionality is implemented in the class
eZPersistentObject. The design of this package should be based around this
class. However, a general cleanup of the class is necessary. It should also
be refactored to use PHP 5 properties.

Requirements
=============

Most importantly you must be able to do the most basic operations on an object:

- create a new with default values
- copy another from another
- fetch an object from the database
- delete and object from the database
- fetch a list of objects based on some conditions
- remove a list of objects

The persistent object must be able do deal with

- sorting
- types
- property visibility
- required fields
- (auto) incrementing fields

There must also be an option for quick access to records without having to 
instantiate a lot of objects.

Design
======

Class design
------------

ezcPersistentObject
    This class implements the persistent object with the above requirements.
    In order to use it you must inherit it and define the various properties,
    and implement the definition method which is used to tell 
    ezcPersistentObject what your object looks like.

ezcPersistentRecord
   This class contains the main functionality for ezcPersistentObject as static
   methods that work on the Record level (array of attribute data). This class
   can also be used if you have large amounts of persistent objects to deal
   with.

ezcPeristentObjectValidator
   This is a convenience class that contains functionality to check if your
   ezcPersistentObject definitions are valid or not.
