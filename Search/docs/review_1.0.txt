General
=======

- There are quite some CS errors, check the following report:

.. include:: review_1.0_cs.txt
   :literal:

- Provide an interface which class may implement, that defines the signature
  for setState() and getState(), so that I may easily ensure that my search
  document wrapper classes match the required signature.

  I think it is OK, to make it optional to implement this interface, though.

- Check if getState() really returns all properties defined in XML structure,
  otherwise "undefined index" notices are returned (handlers/solr.php on line
  778).

- On reconstruction of search results make setState a public *static* method,
  so that the constructor is not called (a constructor with required arguments
  would currently cause a fatal error).

- On recreation with the search results in handlers/solr.php line 375 the
  public ID property from the object is accessed. Is this really necessary, or
  would it be possible to get it from the actual results to reduce the
  assumptions on the search result objects?

  - Fixed, we can just get it from the $attr array anyway.
