Design description
==================

The design of the component allows to be flexible in where the tree structure
information is stored (called backends) and where the data that is associated
with the tree structure is stored (called DataStore). The backends provide
methods to operate on the tree and fetch nodes. All different data stores
can theoretically be used through any backend. All database related backends
and data stores will reside in the TreeDatabaseTiein component, and the
persistent object related data store in the TreePersistentObjectTiein component.


Utility Classes
---------------

ezcTreeNode
```````````

A small class containing the node ID and data belonging to the node. Objects
of this class are the main interface to nodes. The data in the node can be
either pre-fetched or fetch on demand. That depends whether pre-fetching is
turned on, and whether a data store supports it. Operations can be done on tree
nodes as well, such as checking whether it has children, fetching a sub tree.
Those methods will call corresponding methods on the tree object to actually
perform the check/action.

Example::

    <?php
    $node2 = $tree->fetchById( 2 );
    $node1 = $tree->fetchById( 1 );
    $node2->isChildOf( $node1 );

    $node2->hasChildren();
    $subTree = $node1->fetchSubtree();
    ?>

It is possible to change the ezcTreeNode type to a class of your own, by
setting the nodeClassName property of the Tree object. The user defined class
should inherit the ezcTreeNode class though.


ezcTreeNodeList
```````````````

Contains a list of ezcTreeNode nodes that can also be accessed (read-only) like
an array. Example::

    <?php
    $list = new ezcTreeNodeList;
    $list->addNode( new ezcTreeNode( $this, $nodeId ) );
    ?>

ezcTreeNodeListIterator
```````````````````````

Implements an iterator over a ezcTreeNodeList and fetches data on-demand in case
it was not prefetched yet. Example::

    <?php
    foreach ( new ezcTreeNodeListIterator( $tree, $nodeList ) as $id => $data )
    {
        self::assertSame( "Node $id", $data );
    }
    ?>


Backends
--------

ezcTree
```````

An abstract class from which all the other backends extend. It provides
functionality to access the datastore and creating a new tree node. It will
also define the methods that operate on whole trees, such as `Topological
Sorting`_.

This class also defines all the methods that provide operations on nodes and
trees. Below a list of those abstract methods that have to be implemented in
the backends.

Fetching nodes
______________

public function fetchNodeById( $id );
    Returns the node associated with the ID $id.
public function fetchChildren( $id );
    Returns all the children of the node with ID $id.
public function fetchPath( $id );
    Returns all the nodes in the path from the root node to the node with ID
    $id, including those two nodes.
public function fetchSubtree( $id );
	Alias for fetchSubtreeDepthFirst().
public function fetchSubtreeBreadthFirst( $id );
	Returns the node with ID $id and all its children, sorted according to the
	`Breadth-first sorting`_ algorithm.
public function fetchSubtreeDepthFirst( $id );
	Returns the node with ID $id and all its children, sorted according to the
	`Depth-first sorting`_ algorithm.
public function fetchSubtreeTopological( $id );
	Returns the node with ID $id and all its children, sorted according to the
	`Topological sorting`_ algorithm.


Information querying methods
____________________________

public function getChildCount( $id );
    Returns the number of direct children of the node with ID $id
public function getChildCountRecursive( $id );
    Returns the number of children of the node with ID $id, recursively
public function getPathLength( $id );
    Returns the distance from the root node to the node with ID $id
public function hasChildNodes( $id );
    Returns whether the node with ID $id has children
public function isChildOf( $childId, $parentId );
    Returns whether the node with ID $childId is a direct child of the node
    with ID $parentId
public function isDescendantOf( $childId, $parentId );
    Returns whether the node with ID $childId is a direct or indirect child of
    the node with ID $parentId
public function isSiblingOf( $child1Id, $child2Id );
    Returns whether the nodes with IDs $child1Id and $child2Id are siblings (ie,
    the share the same parent)
public function nodeExists( $id );
    Returns whether the node with ID $id exists

Tree modification methods
_________________________

public function createNode( $id, $data );
    Creates a new tree node, which you can append to the tree by calling
    appendChild() on the ezcTreeNode_ object
public function setRootNode( ezcTreeNode $node );
    Sets a new node as root node, this wipes also out the whole tree
public function delete( $id );
    Deletes the node with ID $id from the tree, including all its children
public function move( $id, $targetParentId );
    Moves the node with ID $id as child to the node with ID $targetParentId

Transaction methods (implemented in ezcTree)
____________________________________________

- public function beginTransaction();
- public function commit();
- public function rollback();

ezcTreeDb
`````````

This abstract class is the base class for all backends that work on databases.
It implements the ezcTreeBackend interface that defines which operations are
possible on the tree structure (such as fetchChildren(), fetchPath() etc). It
can also offer some of the generic functions that all the database backends
will have in common (such as checking if a node exists f.e.).

ezcTreeDbParentChild
````````````````````

Is one of the implementations of a Database backend. This one models the tree
structure as a simple parent-child node ID list. The backend implements
all the necessary operations which can not be shared between the different
algorithms of storing trees. Example::

    <?php
        $tree = new ezcTreeDbParentChild(                                            
            ezcDbInstance::get(),
            'parent_child',
            $store
        );
    ?>

The table schema looks like::

    CREATE TABLE 'parent_child' (
        'id' integer NOT NULL,
        'parent_id' integer
    );
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX 'parent_child_pri' ON 'parent_child' ( 'id' );

The root node is the only node that has 'parent_id' set to NULL.  If for
performance reasons more fields are useful (such as level), they will be added
as well. The backend also works if the data types for 'id' and 'parent_id' are
varchars, and not integers - however, this has an impact on performance. It is
also possible to add more fields that can be filled in through `callbacks`_.


ezcTreeDbSerializedPath
```````````````````````

Is an implementation of a Serialized/`Materialized path`_ algorithm for 
storing tree structures in a database. The table schema looks like::

    CREATE TABLE 'serialized_path' (
        'id' integer NOT NULL,
        'path' varchar(255) not null
    );
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX 'serialized_path_pri' on 'serialized_path' ( 'id' );
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX 'serialized_path_path' on 'serialized_path' ( 'path' );

The backend also works if the data type for 'id' is a varchar, and not an
integer - however, this has an impact on performance. The size of the 'path'
field is the limiting factor for the depth of the tree; the component will not
check whether the stored paths will fit in the field. It is possible to create
a schema that defines a larger field here, but that might have performance
issues depending on the database being used. It is also possible to add more
fields that can be filled in through `callbacks`_.

ezcTreeDbNestedSet
``````````````````

Is another implementation of a Database backend, where the tree information
is kept like a `nested set`_. The table schema looks like::

    CREATE TABLE nested_set (
        'id' integer NOT NULL,
        'parent_id' integer,
        'lft' integer NOT NULL,
        'rgt' integer NOT NULL
    );
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX 'nested_set_pri' on 'nested_set' ( 'id' );
    CREATE INDEX 'nested_set_left' on 'nested_set' ( 'left' );
    CREATE INDEX 'nested_set_right' on 'nested_set' ( 'right' );

The backend also works if the data type for 'id' is a varchar, and not an
integer - however, this has an impact on performance. It is also possible
to add more fields that can be filled in through `callbacks`_.

ezcTreeXml
``````````

This class implements the tree structure in an XML file. The structure of
this XML file is simply a nested set of nodes. See below for a
Relax NG-C version of the structure::

    default namespace = "http://components.ez.no/Tree"
    namespace etd = "http://components.ez.no/Tree/data"

    start = element tree { node }
    node =
      element node {
      attribute id { xsd:integer },
      element etd:data { text }?,
      (node)*
    }


Data Stores
-----------

ezcTreeDataStore
````````````````

Interface that defines the methods that all data stores should implement, such
as retrieving data for a node, or a list of nodes, storing data for a node etc.
Stores are simple to implement, as the interfaces only consists of a few types.
The component will contain the example data stores
`ezcTreeDbExternalTableDataStore`_ and `ezcTreePersistentObjectDataStore`_
(through a Tiein). An overview of the methods:

- public function fetchDataForNode( ezcTreeNode $node );
- public function fetchDataForNodes( ezcTreeNodeList $nodeList );
- public function storeDataForNode( ezcTreeNode $node );

Callbacks
_________

To allow for meta data to be set, it is possible to configure callbacks for
storing node data. This you do by setting the 'onStoreCallback' property of the
data store to a callback method.

ezcTreeDbDataStore
``````````````````

Abstract base class that implements some methods that can be shared by all the
different database related backends - such as nodeExists().

ezcTreeDbExternalTableDataStore
```````````````````````````````

A data store that implements storing of data in table different from the table
that defines the tree structure. Example::

    <?php
        $store = new ezcTreeDbExternalTableDataStore( $this->dbh );
        // table name, ID field, data field
        $store->setDataTable( 'data', 'id', 'data' );
    ?>

ezcTreePersistentObjectDataStore
````````````````````````````````

Uses eZ Component's PersistentObject as a place to store data that is associated
in a tree structure.



Algorithms
==========

Examples
--------

Below a few examples on how to use the tree component.

Creating a tree
```````````````

Code::

    <?php
        $tree = ezcTreeXml::create(
            $this->tempDir . '/new-tree.xml', 
            new ezcTreeXmlInternalDataStore()
        );

        $node = $tree->createNode( 1, "Root Node" );
        $tree->setRootNode( $node );

        $node2 = $tree->createNode( 2, "Node 2" );
        $node->addChild( $node2 );

        $node->addChild( $node3 = $tree->createNode( 3, "Node 3" ) );
        $node3->addChild( $tree->createNode( 4, "Node 3.4" ) );
    ?>

The example creates the following tree structure::

    1 - Root Node
      |
      + 2 - Node 2
      |
      + 3 - Node 3
          |
          + 4 - Node 3.4

Querying the tree
`````````````````

The following example makes use of the follow structure (in XML)::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE tree PUBLIC "" "">
    <tree xmlns="http://components.ez.no/Tree" xmlns:etd="http://components.ez.no/Tree/data">
        <node id="id1">
            <etd:data>Node 1</etd:data>
            <node id="id2">
                <etd:data>Node 2</etd:data>
            </node>
            <node id="id3">
                <etd:data>Node 3</etd:data>
            </node>
            <node id="id4">
                <etd:data>Node 4</etd:data>
                <node id="id6">
                    <etd:data>Node 6</etd:data>
                    <node id="id7">
                        <etd:data>Node 7</etd:data>
                    </node>
                    <node id="id8">
                        <etd:data>Node 8</etd:data>
                    </node>
                </node>
            </node>
            <node id="id5">
                <etd:data>Node 5</etd:data>
                <node id="id9">
                    <etd:data>Node 9</etd:data>
                </node>
            </node>
        </node>
    </tree>

Code::

    <?php
    // checking if a node exists:
    $node1Exists = $tree->nodeExists( '1' );

    // fetching a node:
    $node8 = $tree->fetchNodeById( '8' );

    // checking whether a node is a child of another node:
    $tree->fetchNodeById( '2' )->isChildOf( $tree->fetchNodeById( '1' ) );
    $tree->isChildOf( '2', '1' );

    // checking whether a node has children, and how many:
    $tree->fetchNodeById( '1' )->hasChildNodes();
    $tree->fetchNodeById( '1' )->getChildCount();
    $tree->hasChildNodes( '3' );
    $tree->getChildCount( '3' );

    // fetching a subtree:
    $tree->fetchNodeById( '4' )->fetchSubtree();
    $nodeList = $tree->fetchSubtree( '4' );

    // iterating over a node list:
    foreach ( new ezcTreeNodeListIterator( $tree, $nodeList ) as $id => $data )
    {
        echo "Node $id has data:\n";
        var_dump( $data );
    }
    ?>


_`Materialized Path`
--------------------

An algorithm that stores parent-child relations in the form of paths. For an
overview of how this works, see `Trees in SQL
<http://www.dbazine.com/oracle/or-articles/tropashko4>`_


_`Nested Set`
-------------

An algorithm that stores parent-child relations with the help of left-right
integers. For an overview of how this works, see `Trees in SQL
<http://www.dbazine.com/oracle/or-articles/tropashko4>`_

Sorting
-------

The component supports a few different methods of sorting subtrees. Those
algoritms can be used with the fetchSubtree() method (specified in the 2nd
parameter).

Breadth-first sorting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns the subtree in the order of distance to the root node.  See
`Breadth-first search <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search>`_ for
more information on the algorithm.

Depth-first sorting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns the subtree by returning the nodes in level 0, then level 1... etc. See
`Depth-first search <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search>`_ for
more information on the algorithm.

Topological Sorting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A sorting method that can sort the information in a tree in such a way that the
leaf nodes are on top. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting


Data Structures
===============

Node IDs
    All node IDs can be strings, but their charaters are restricted to what
    you can put into a PHP array key and XML attribute string.
